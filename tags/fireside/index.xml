I have always dreamed of blogging. I have even tried once called 20MinuteRants. They worked quite well as a basic format whereby I can write about things in a fairly efficient manner (hence the 20 minutes), and be able to reflect about the things I&amp;rsquo;m up to.
The problem with the project is that I rarely had the motivation to do one.</description></item></channel></rss>
