<meta name=description content="scheduling is the tool to figure out which thread can run. Because threads exist in different thread states:

running
blockde - waiting for an event like disk, network, etc.
ready - able to run, but not on CPU yet

a scheduler needs to do the task of ordering ready threads to run, moving running threads to ready when it has ran for enough time. Possible pathways:

ready => running
blocked => running
blocked => ready => running

You can&rsquo;t go from ready to blocked because you have to do something to know you are blocked."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>
