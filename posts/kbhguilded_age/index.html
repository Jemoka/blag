Immigrants were stuffed into Tennaments. The Guilded age saw the beginning of skyscrapers.</p><h3 id=social-activism>Social Activism</h3><p>Because of the issues began during the Guilded Age, more people essentially stepped instead of the governement to play a role in supporting welfare.</p><h3 id=industrialization>Industrialization</h3><p>&ldquo;Pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.&rdquo; <em>Steel</em> is invented. All of the technology has been moved to provide maximum output; this comes, of course, at an environmental cost. Large unions are starting to take off. Railroad Strike: federal troops fired upon railroad workers; argued the case for union but also for corp. influence on politics.</p><h3 id=politics>Politics</h3><ul><li>Democrats: racist, states rights, limited federal government.</li><li>Republicans: supported businesses, immigrations.</li></ul><p>Yes, they are still flipped.</p><p>But either way, democracy was rampant: 80% turnout! This is, however, one of the most corrupt time in American politics. The party system: local political bosses would provide favours for a vote &mdash; in an absence of welfare, in exchange for a vote, wolud provide protection and social welfare. At this time, there was mass lack of reliance.</p><h3 id=culture>Culture</h3><p>Victorianism! Proper manners, conservatism, etc. Bikes and contraceptives! There is also a fear that &ldquo;manliness was declining&rdquo;: that no more farming means need for more sports, body building, etc. Also, &ldquo;name brands&rdquo;, &ldquo;sears catalogue&rdquo;, and consumerism is taking hold.</p><h3 id=corportization>Corportization</h3><p>Corporations, as an idea, took hold. That the owners of a group is seperated by management, it allows the expansion of the size of companies. Monopolies in industries run while: concentrated wealth in addition to corrupted politics.</p><p>Taylorism: Taylor decided to make a shovel for each type of movement &mdash; which makes people repeat the same task over again but increased efficiency. &ldquo;Taylor-made&rdquo; comes from this.</p><h3 id=omaha-platform>Omaha Platform</h3><ul><li>Expanding Credit</li><li>Bracketed income tax</li><li>Social reforms</li></ul><p>Lays the groundwork for the progressive moment.

It doesn&rsquo;t talk about how the economy effects the social standings and ladders that people lived in => that movement comes from a lot of social change.</p><p>Made a point about the positive/negatives effects of the guilded age: don&rsquo;t focus the individuals but instead the structures.</p><p>He did not want the &ldquo;progressive era&rdquo; as a classification in line with the guilded age. &ldquo;Guilded age&rdquo; is the only pejorative term for an era: so one negative description does not do it justice.</p><h3 id=richard-benzel>Richard Benzel</h3><p>Richard Benzel claims that the textbook industry primes people; that a title for an age shoehorns the age and changes the reflection of the reader.</p></div></article></main><footer><p id=footer>&copy; 2019-2025 Houjun Liu.
