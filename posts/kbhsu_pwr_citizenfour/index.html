<meta name=description content="general choice of sound

ominous/bad: low tonal drone
surveillance: loud high frequency buzz
final ending music contrasts with erythidng



uses immediate dialogue with no visuals to present focus

rawness/truth of the dialogue (and arguably Snowden&rsquo;s good job at phrasing) makes it more compelling
nat sound without visuals provide additional focus


background music modulates emotional valence



fairly significant use of nat packages to emphasize reality
the tone of the reading also modulates the opinion



the confrontation of the court creates tension
parallel contrasting statements



transition to Snowden interview feels relatively peaceful compared to the beginning, which is drawing attention in its own way
the jovial nature being in the room contrasts to the serious issue at hand
the cuts are really quite hard: to emphasize contrast between loud news breaks and the quietness of the hotel room&mdash;especially large contrast with regards to Ed Snowden&rsquo;s wife being raided, etc., which is rather peaceful

or the quiet of TV television as compared to the loud noise of the nat package behind






the lack of speaking from the camera operator/sounds behind the makes the scene much more intimate"><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>
