<meta name=description content="A friend recently asked for recommendations for shoes and jackets, and I realized that the links on my gear page has slowly died (very sad). So I figured I should update it with more information and alternatives.
What I (normatively) do
I&rsquo;ll give specific recommendations shortly, but before I do that I feel like it&rsquo;d be helpful to give some normative statements about what &ldquo;good&rdquo; gear to me feels like.
light, and waterproof, in that order
I try to get things that are both waterproof and light, and if both doesn&rsquo;t exist (in particular for shoes), I prioritize being light."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>

In particular this is why I refuse categorically to wear Adidas clothing because of the stupid stripes. I try to buy cloths that minimal in style (i.e., MUJI).</p><h3 id=get-it--in-spirit--from-rei>get it (in spirit) from REI</h3><p>Like for carabiners, so with cloths. If it works to save hikers&rsquo; life, it surely works for some urban scrambling. Try to get things that are battle-tested or at least variants of them.</p><p>This, of course, assumes that you do what I do which is buy this once and use it for as long as you don&rsquo;t loose it, up to replacing and resurfacing. Fashion and/or daily travel doesn&rsquo;t work this way.</p><p>Often you will realize that performance requirements change dramatically if you are actually using them to do things. A pair of normal khakis are $50ish, the same technical pants for EMS are upwards of $80. Not a huge difference, but it does make one.</p><h3 id=a-note-about-cost>a note about cost</h3><p>gear I end up choosing are largely super duper expensive (your tax dollars at work!); I buy very little other things, so it mostly works out, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean your actual cost is actually this high. For instance, for jackets (in particular not! shoes; break in shoes by yourself), second hand + retreating the Gore-Tex fabric often does wonders.</p><h2 id=what-i-do>What I do</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s begin with what I actually wear; mostly these are no longer on sale except for the second-hard market.</p><h3 id=jacket>Jacket</h3><p>In terms of rain jackets you can&rsquo;t really get better than the ultralight jackets from Arcteryx.</p><ul><li>I loved the Norvan SL, but at the time it was more out of range: <a href=https://www.rei.com/product/117215/arcteryx-norvan-sl-hoodie-mens>https://www.rei.com/product/117215/arcteryx-norvan-sl-hoodie-mens</a></li><li>or, its sibling, Norvan LT, which was more in range: <a href=https://geartrade.com/products/arcteryx-norvan-lt-hoody-mens-1067816>https://geartrade.com/products/arcteryx-norvan-lt-hoody-mens-1067816</a> (used link for $200!)</li></ul><p>Arcteryx apparently still sells this line of Jackets, just at a stupid high price of $450: <a href=https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/norvan-jacket-9571>https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/norvan-jacket-9571</a>. I can&rsquo;t vouch for how good they are physically, but from product photos they look much stupider than the original versions if nothing else but the enormous logo.</p><h3 id=shoes>Shoes</h3><p>I wear three types of shoes, two for daily carry, both from Merrill, and one for support, being Asics.</p><ul><li><strong>summer</strong>: for non-rainy-seasons, and in terms of general carry, there&rsquo;s nothing in my opinion that beats the Embark Lace sneaker: <a href="https://www.merrell.com/US/en/embark-lace-sneaker/52565M.html?dwvar_52565M_color=J067217">https://www.merrell.com/US/en/embark-lace-sneaker/52565M.html?dwvar_52565M_color=J067217</a> (for some reason, only this hilarious aqua colour is available, but for $50 bucks!)</li><li><strong>winter</strong>: sadly you can only buy these used, but for trail hiking/weather withstanding, the Gore-Tex MQM-3 from Merrill is light and unbeatable: <a href=https://www.ebay.com/itm/126614314821>https://www.ebay.com/itm/126614314821</a> (they don&rsquo;t see it anymore :/)</li><li><strong>running*/*tennis</strong>: asics Gel-Kayano: <a href=https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-kayano/c/aa50101000/>https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-kayano/c/aa50101000/</a> (much like wands, everybody and they running shoes is a 1 to 1 match, I wouldn&rsquo;t overindex on this)</li></ul><h2 id=what-i-recommend>What I recommend</h2><p>I have no clue why I&rsquo;m qualified to give product recommendation, but here goes. Also here&rsquo;s a <a href=https://www.thepackablelife.com/hiking/gear/ultralight-backpacking-gear>fun ultralight packing list</a> which is cool.</p><h3 id=jacket>Jacket</h3><ul><li>$300-400 range: <a href=https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-m10-storm-waterproof-alpine-jacket/85910.html#>M10 from Patagonia</a> (10 oz), or <a href=https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/norvan-jacket-9571>Arc&rsquo;teryx&rsquo;s stupid looking new Norvans</a> (7.6 oz)</li><li>sub-$200 range: Montbell Versalite Jacket (6.4 oz!, this is on sale somewhere, but for some reason you can&rsquo;t buy it in the US?)</li><li>sub-$100 range: <a href=https://www.rei.com/product/227570/rei-co-op-rainier-rain-jacket-mens>REI Rainier Rain Jacket</a> (11.3 oz)</li><li>sub-$30, a garbage bag to put over you: <a href=https://www.froggtoggs.com/products/the-frogg-toggsr-ultra-lite2tm-4749>Frog Toggs Ultra-Lite2</a></li></ul><h3 id=shoes>Shoes</h3><p>I feel unqualified as to give shoe opinions because they can&rsquo;t be measured as easily. Also I find that decent shoes are always in the $50 - $150 price range, unless something is up or you run marathons.</p><h4 id=summer>Summer</h4><p>Other than the admittedly garish colour, I think one can&rsquo;t beat the <a href="https://www.merrell.com/US/en/embark-lace-sneaker/52565M.html?dwvar_52565M_color=J067217&amp;icid=search_suggested_products">Embark Lace</a>. Its slip on, breathable, very light (7.19 oz) <strong>non-water-proof</strong>. Overall pretty happy.</p><h4 id=winter>Winter</h4><p>I still wear my <a href=https://www.merrell.com/UK/en_GB/mqm-3-gore-tex/52476M.html>MQM-3</a> (11.63 oz) daily, and if you can find it, you shod too; I heard <a href=https://www.merrell.com/US/en/agility-peak-5-gore-tex/58253M.html>Agility Peak Gore Tex</a> running shoes are pretty good, but it really isn&rsquo;t a shoe for more technical scrambling, etc.</p><h4 id=running>Running</h4><p>You can still buy a Gel-Kayano. But your mileage may vary and you should visit a Footlocker.</p></div></article></main><footer><p id=footer>&copy; 2019-2025 Houjun Liu. Licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.</p></footer></div></body></html>
