ineffability of language vs. Sapire-Wolf
Foreignizing Time in Heptopod B
Louise&rsquo;s ability to re-express her temporally-independent thoughts in English after learning Heptopod B represents a successful act foreignization of Heptopod thought for an English L1 audience despite this audience&rsquo;s supposed limitations in understanding temporally-independent concepts according to the Sapir-Wholf Hypothesis.
Heptopod B does not have temporality

RUSSIAN SCIENTIST: &ldquo;Their final words translate to, &ldquo;There is no time, many become one.&rdquo; I fear we have all been given weapons because we answered the timeline wrong, please, if you - -&rdquo;
&ldquo;Explain it by saying that light minimized the time needed to travel to its destination, and one saw the world as the heptapods saw it.&rdquo;

So it seems like quintessential Sapir-Wholf: time hard to express with Heptopod, and so their way of thinking work around it."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>
