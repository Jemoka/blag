While both a lust for Othello&rsquo;s power and Rodrigo&rsquo;s provocations of Iago drove him initially to begin his scheme, it is Iago&rsquo;s internal racist hatred of Othello as a person that allowed his plot to fully come to fruition.
Establish pattern two othellos: othello the person &ldquo;the moor&rdquo;, and othello the general &ldquo;othello&rdquo;
The four texts&rsquo; Iagos can be treated in the same framework of &ldquo;love&rdquo;&ndash;hatred, whether racial or otherwise, for Othello&mdash;versus &ldquo;respect&rdquo;&mdash;deference to the authority of Othello."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>

The film is one which Iago and Othello were ostensibly friends&mdash;during the subtext perhaps more of a reflection for civil rights sentiment (especially via the counter-culture language of Jazz of the time) &ldquo;apparently natural construct of a racially diverse &mldr; sub-culture: &rsquo;the [diverse racial archetypes] intermingle smoothly and fraternisation creates deep emotional pangs, rather than embarrassment&rsquo;&rdquo; (Kinematograph Weekly) (Burton and O&rsquo;Sullivan)</p><p>Critics hated particularly the soft ending: &ldquo;never for one moment succeeds in achieving anything like the power and persuasion of the original.&rdquo; (Films and Filming) Why is the soft-ending? When Othello almost smoothered Desdemona, three people went and checked immediatley, and there was no Emilia&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Moor&rsquo;s abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave&rdquo;. She immediately doubted Iago, confusion was cleared, and all was well.</p><p>So though Rodrigo ignited Iago&rsquo;s scheme, racism dragged Iago&rsquo;s scheme long enough for both to be dead.</p><hr><h2 id=bhardwaj-s-othello-rodrigo-convinced-merge-between-two-othellos-setting-forward-motion>Bhardwaj&rsquo;s Othello: Rodrigo Convinced Merge between two Othellos, setting forward motion</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzgDHT3inzI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzgDHT3inzI</a></p><p>Iago provoked by Rodrigo jeering him: &ldquo;no more of drowning, do you hear?&rdquo; &ldquo;I could jump into this river&rdquo; &mldr; &ldquo;well jump! Don&rsquo;t be a sissy [sic].&rdquo; Then Rodrigo provoked Iago about how Iago was slighted by Othello; relegating Iago to a role in &ldquo;Company Garden&rdquo;.</p><p>It is at this moment that the music swells, ominous vocal tones that reprises from the beginning titles of the film, of &ldquo;title faintly visible images of what appear to be ancient scenes of combat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bhardwaj composes all his film scores and writes music and script simultaneously&rdquo;, so the intentionality here is not to be missed. Motivated more by a masculine sense of revenge against <strong>General Othello</strong>, Iago decided to take personal action against the hated <strong>Moor</strong>.</p><p>Odd choice, too, to relegate Iago to &ldquo;company garden.&rdquo; Turns out, Shakesphere defined it for us! &ldquo;Our bodies are gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; &mldr; we have reason to cool our &mldr; unbitted lusts; &mldr; I take this, that you call love, to be a sect or scion.&rdquo; Iago claims love is a &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; of unbitted lust, which he should cut. Metaphorically cutting Othello&rsquo;s the person&rsquo;s love for desdemona as if he&rsquo;s mechanically cutting away some lust; all to achieve a goal for General Othello.</p><p>&ldquo;Othello should go mad&rdquo;</p><h2 id=comparing-iago>Comparing Iago</h2><ul><li>No Love, No respect | Direct objective: to get Othello&rsquo;s position at <strong>the Met</strong></li><li>Yes Love, Yes Respect | Direct objective: to remove Desdemona from Othello&rsquo;s control and start a <strong>band</strong></li><li>No Love, Yes Respect | Direct objective: faithful&mdash;to get Othello to choose him as the direct regional militia leader &lt;> Shakesphere</li></ul><p>Missing: Yes Love, Yes Respect</p><h2 id=actual-othello>Actual Othello</h2><ul><li>IAGO: &ldquo;No more of drowning, do you hear?&rdquo; &lt;> Omkara</li></ul><h2 id=bhardwaj-s-iago>Bhardwaj&rsquo;s Iago</h2><ul><li>Direct objective: faithful&mdash;to get Othello to choose him as the direct regional militia leader</li><li>Hidden objective: &mldr;??? not sure not well motivated</li><li>Direct Downfall of Othello: &ldquo;ocular proof&rdquo; of jingly heirloom</li><li>Main Methods<ul><li>&lt;> Shakesphere beer to Cassio</li><li>&lt;> Shakesphere making Othello overhear conversation with Cassio about Bianca to think its about Desdemona</li><li>&lt;> Shakesphere convinces Desdemona to soothsay for Cassio</li><li>Random bad omen about bird/snake?</li><li>&lt;> Shakesphere Heirloom</li></ul></li><li>Distinctions<ul><li>Process of manipulation is more toxically masculine instead of weird submissiveness</li><li>&ldquo;I hate Moor&rdquo; + drowning scene took place somewhat after being provoked by Rodrigo firing his jealousy after Iago fired Rodrigo&rsquo;s jealousy about Desdemona</li></ul></li><li>Unique shots/catchphrases/features<ul><li>Instances of violence/impending violence underscored by very cheerful music<ul><li>Cheerful music as Othello beats up everybody in the rival gang</li><li>Happy cheerful party music as Cassio becomes drunk and gets demoted</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=sax-s-iago>Sax&rsquo;s Iago</h2><ul><li>Direct objective: to get Othello&rsquo;s position at <strong>the Met</strong></li><li>Hidden objective: [racism for]/[sexual desire for] Othello</li><li>Direct Downfall of Othello: A, B, and C for intimacy test for the <strong>robe</strong></li><li>Main methods<ul><li>&lt;> Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion</li><li>Hinted to Cassio that marriage is not genuine and provoked him</li><li>Screwed up Othello&rsquo;s investigation of the constable</li><li><em>Demanded intimacy test and A, B, AND C</em></li></ul></li><li>Distinctions<ul><li>Wants Othello&rsquo;s position, and probably his love</li><li>Is more explicitly lying (A, B, AND C)</li><li>Is more overtly racist: beginning conversation with Sinclair, the racist (&ldquo;I hate the moor&rdquo; proxy) rant</li><li>Relationship with Emilia seem less strained</li></ul></li><li>Unique shots/catchphrases/features<ul><li>Staring up into the sky w/ shaft of light</li><li>&ldquo;I know what you are talking about, I&rsquo;ve been there&rdquo; prior to manipulation</li><li>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a promise&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=darden-s-iago>Darden&rsquo;s Iago</h2><ul><li>Direct objective: to remove Desdemona from Othello&rsquo;s control and start a <strong>band</strong></li><li>Hidden objective: to date Desdemona</li><li>Direct Downfall of Othello: [the <strong>cigarette box</strong>?] + edited tape recording</li><li>Main Methods<ul><li>&lt;> Shakesphere gave weed to Cassio to cause him to make a scene</li><li>&lt;> Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion re: knowledge from Emilia</li><li>Engineered Desdemona&rsquo;s song to be specifically pointed</li><li>&lt;> Shakesphere &ldquo;ocular proof&rdquo;: cigarette case; also insinuating that Cassio&rsquo;s weed came from Desdemona</li><li>Doctoring the tape to highlight Cassio&rsquo;s supposed infidelity</li></ul></li><li>Distinctions<ul><li>In love with Desdemona and had separate business motivations distinct from taking Othello/Cassio&rsquo;s</li><li>Didn&rsquo;t seem particularly racist, was previously friends with Othello?</li><li>Is more explicitly lying by doctoring tape, but words closer to Shakesphere&rsquo;s Iago</li><li>Didn&rsquo;t succeed</li><li>Most strained relationship with Emilia, &ldquo;I love nobody.
