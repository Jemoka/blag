<meta name=description content="Fireside a series of articles that I&rsquo;m writing to consolidate my learning.
I have always dreamed of blogging. I have even tried once called 20MinuteRants. They worked quite well as a basic format whereby I can write about things in a fairly efficient manner (hence the 20 minutes), and be able to reflect about the things I&rsquo;m up to.
The problem with the project is that I rarely had the motivation to do one."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>

I have even tried once <a href=https://medium.com/20minuterants>called 20MinuteRants</a>. They worked quite well as a basic format whereby I can write about things in a fairly efficient manner (hence the 20 minutes), and be able to reflect about the things I&rsquo;m up to.</p><p>The problem with the project is that I rarely had the motivation to do one. Once I was too busy, or out of ideas to write about, I stop. If there&rsquo;s not anything to rant about, why is there a 20MinuteRant?</p><p>Indeed that has been why the blog has been on hiatus for the past many months. I suppose we can consider this entry the last of the 20MinuteRants and the first one of a new series of writings&mdash;<a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a>&mdash;which I hope will continue for a long time.</p><h2 id=impetus>Impetus</h2><p>My mentor D has always told me to start arguments with why. The larger system in which <a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a> is located, my knowlegebase system, has <a href=/posts/kbhstarting_with_why_the_knowledgebase/>such a page</a> arguing why its a good idea.</p><p>And here&rsquo;s the why: starting university has made me surprisingly lost in terms of what I want to do. In that: there&rsquo;s so much of the vicissitudes of daily life that I no longer have the same intellectual curiosity that I think I had during middle and high school. And, in doing this, I hope to get it back.</p><p>This illustrates the key goal of <a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a>: a once+ per week posting, illustrating some new thing I&rsquo;m aiming to learn for the week. It can even be in the classroom: but something I&rsquo;m going above and beyond to try to understand. Each article will either plan something to learn, or summarize my learning in it.</p><p>I remember seeing an article through HN at one point (<a href=https://addyosmani.com/blog/write-learn/>its not this one, it was significantly less &ldquo;ha ha! business&rdquo; language, but this will do</a>) that &ldquo;You never really learn something until you write about it.&rdquo; A dormmate of mine working on ray tracing also said something to the same effect. And, so, what the heck. Let&rsquo;s try this out.</p><p>A part of me wishes that this fulfills the &ldquo;deliverable&rdquo; in my head of &ldquo;YOU AREN&rsquo;T DOING ENOUGH!&rdquo; whenever I spend time wandering aimlessly to try to learn something. If it has become a <a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a>, it counts. I guess.</p><p>I should also add that <a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a> is named <a href=/posts/kbhfireside/>Fireside</a> because of FDR&rsquo;s <a href=/posts/kbhfireside_chats/>Fireside Chats</a>, where he got to directly talk to people unfiltered about his views.</p><h2 id=parameters>Parameters</h2><h3 id=frequency>Frequency</h3><p>At a minimum once a week. No promises though.</p><h3 id=names>Names</h3><p>You have already noticed one of the parameters. Unless it is a general concept or a well known thing I did, I won&rsquo;t be using names throughout the articles. Somewhat contrarily, I firmly believe that the process of building shit is a very personal one. Hence, following the example of one of my favorite essayists <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhu_Ziqing>Zhu Ziqing</a>, I will be using the first letter of the name I refer to them to refer to all people mentioned. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t want to be included, I&rsquo;d be happy to pull things down.</p><h3 id=themes>Themes</h3><ul><li>technology in general</li><li>random nerdism</li><li>deep learning and language models, methods and applications</li><li>the shit I get up to</li></ul><h2 id=we-begin>We Begin</h2><p>I hope to begin this weekend. I&rsquo;ve spent the last while trying to train a serious deep learning model (read: OpenAI Whisper Large V2), and dying because all I have access to is 2 32GB V-100s on the PSC (and yes, I point out that this is terribly privileged statement: woe is me with a cutting edge GPU).</p><p>However, the <a href=/posts/kbhnlp/#language-model>Language Model</a> literally doesn&rsquo;t fit in the damned box. So, I&rsquo;m trying to learn about distributed training methods like Ray, methods of efficient tuning with LoRA, and new-fangled memory sharing things like DeepSpeed.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p></div></article></main><footer><p id=footer>&copy; 2019-2023 Houjun Liu.
