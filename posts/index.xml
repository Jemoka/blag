Instead, then, we just make them bigger and control them at the same time. We can implement gates via a sequence of pulses. If you work with interacting qubits a lot, you will end up with the APR Paradox.
If you take two qubits, and move them though two gates, you essentially will get entangled results.
To make this works, you will need to take some probability.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</guid><description> \(A\) does all the asking, \(B\) has all the decision making power Population \(A\)&amp;rsquo;s match never goes up at best, they stay the same Population \(B\)&amp;rsquo;s match can never go down.

Consider two populations, \(A\) and \(B\), who want to form paired relationships between a person \(A\) and \(B\). \(A_i\) has a list of their ranked order matches (I want to be paired with \(B_1\) most, \(B_4\) second, etc.), and so does \(B_i\) (I want to be paired with \(A_4\) most \(A_9\) second, etc.)

The purpose of AIBridge is to bridge the gap between computer science and other disciplines. To many, working with AI might seem like an unreachable objective. However, in reality, one week is enough to get started. AIBridge will provide basic programming capability in Python and knowledge of object-oriented programming as well as the concepts behind machine learning and how to implement it using a popular toolbox, Scikit-Learn.</description></item><item><title>AIBridge Final Project</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_final_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_final_project/</guid><description>Part 1: ML Training Practice One of the things that makes a very good Sommelier is their ability to figure out as much details about a wine as possible with very little information.

We are super excited to work through tasks in linear regression and logistic regression, as well as familiarize you with the Iris dataset.
Iris Dataset Let&amp;rsquo;s load the Iris dataset! Begin by importing the load_iris tool from sklearn. This is an easy loader scheme for the iris dataset.
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris Then, we simply execute the following to load the data.
x,y = load_iris(return_X_y=True) We use the return_X_y argument here so that, instead of dumping a large CSV, we get the neat-cleaned input and output values.</description></item><item><title>AIBridgeLab D3/D4</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridgelab_d3_d4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridgelab_d3_d4/</guid><description>Woah!

You know what&amp;rsquo;s better than one neural network? TWO!!! Multi-modal approaches&amp;mdash;making two neural networks interact for a certain result&amp;mdash;dominate many of the current edge of neural network research.

As I begin to write this I should add that this unit is going to be conceptually dense. Though we are teaching one particular algorithm (incidentally, named, REINFORCE), the world of reinforcement learning is build by one, if not many, very advanced treatments in maths.
So if anything, I would focus on getting the conceptual flavor of how these problems are formulated and discuses.

One-Liner extracted lexicographic and syntactical features from ADReSS Challenge data and trained it on various models, with BERT performing the best.
Novelty ???????
Seems like results here are a strict subset of Zhu 2021. Same sets of dataprep of Antonsson 2021 but trained on a BERT now. Seem to do worse than Antonsson 2021 too.
Notable Methods Essentially Antonsson 2021

if we are only interested in a function in terms of different values of \(a\), \(P(M)\) is not that interesting. Therefore, we can just calculate \(A\) for all \(a\), and then normalize it to sum to 1:

We propose a novel data harvesting scheme leveraging lead paragraphs in Wikipedia to train automated context-aware lexicographical models. Furthermore, we present ConDef, a fine-tuned BART trained on the harvested data that defines vocabulary terms from a short context. ConDef is determined to be highly accurate in context-dependent lexicography as validated on ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L measures in an 1000-item withheld test set, achieving scores of 46.</description></item><item><title>conditional Gaussian model</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhconditional_gaussian_models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhconditional_gaussian_models/</guid><description>Say you have one continuous variable \(X\), and one discrete variable \(Y\), and you desire to express the probability of \(X\) conditioned upon \(Y\) using a gaussian model:

constructor theory can give us a theory of the universal quantum constructor by expanding upon quantum information theory. It allows us to unify quantum and classical information by simply defining operations in terms of counterfactuals exclusively: that a space is entirely defined by what&amp;rsquo;s possible and what&amp;rsquo;s not possible.
According to constructor theory, fundamental laws are not dynamical laws instead are boundary conditions.</description></item><item><title>continuity correct</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcontinuity_correct/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcontinuity_correct/</guid><description/></item><item><title>continuity correction</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcontinuity_correction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcontinuity_correction/</guid><description>Because we want to including rounding during continuity correction to account for things discretized to certain values.

\begin{equation} p(x) \dd{x} \end{equation}
You will note that, at any given exact point, the probability is \(\lim_{\dd{x} \to 0} p(x)\dd{x} = 0\). However, to get the actual probability, we take an integral over some range:
\begin{equation} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \dd{x} = 1 \end{equation}

Every operator on a finite-dimensional, non-zero, complex vector space has an eigenvalue.
Proof:
Suppose \(V\) is a complex vector space with dimension \(n &amp;gt; 0\), and \(T \in \mathcal{L}(V)\). Choose \(v \in V, v\neq 0\) (possible as \(V\) is non-zero):
Construct a list of \(n+1\) vectors:

The statistic is defined as:

where, \(N\) is the total number of words, \(U\) the total number of distinct words, \(N_{uni}\) the number of total distinct words used only once.

Reflection The discussion here of the conflict between &amp;ldquo;saltwater&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;freshwater&amp;rdquo; (Keynesian and Neoclassical) economists is very interesting when evaluated from the perspective of our recent impending recession.
One particular statement that resonated with me in the essay was the fact that a crisis simply &amp;ldquo;pushed the freshwater economists into further absurdity.&amp;rdquo; It is interesting to see that, once a theory has been well-established and insulated in a community, it becomes much more difficult to parcel out as something that could be wrong.</description></item><item><title>hypothesis testing</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhhypothesis_testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhhypothesis_testing/</guid><description>hypothesis testing is the mechanism by which a hypothesis is tested statistically.

First, recall the stationary-action principle. To define a system in Lagrangian Mechanics, we define a smooth function \(L\), called the &amp;ldquo;Lagrangian&amp;rdquo;, and some configuration space (axis) \(M\).
By convention, \(L=T-V\). \(T\) is the kinetic energy in the system, and \(V\) is the potential energy in the system.

Let&amp;rsquo;s take two vectors \(\vec{u} \in V\) and \(\vec{v} \in V\). The orthogonal vector to the both of them (i.e. the normal direction of the plane) is:
\begin{equation} \vec{u}\times \vec{v} \end{equation}
by the definition of the cross product.
The points on the plane, therefore, have to be orthogonal themselves to this normal vector. This means that the dot product of the candidate vector against these vectors should be \(0\):</description></item><item><title>NUS-MATH530 Similar to Diagonal</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhnus_math530_similar_to_diagonal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhnus_math530_similar_to_diagonal/</guid><description>Prove but \(T\) is diagonalizable if and only if the matrix of \(T\) is similar to a diagonal matrix.

Indeed the &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; of Linear Maps is just function composition. Of course, \(ST\) is defined only when \(T\) maps to something in the domain of \(S\).

So, if you think about the Product of Vector Space:
\begin{equation} \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \end{equation}
you are essentially taking the \(x\) axis straight line and &amp;ldquo;duplicating&amp;rdquo; it along the \(y\) axis.
Now, the opposite of this is the quotient space:
\begin{equation} \mathbb{R}^{2} / \left\{\mqty(a \\ 0): a \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \end{equation}
Where, we are essentially taking the line in the \(x\) axis and squish it down, leaving us only the \(y\) component freedom to play with (as each element is \(v +\left\{\mqty(a \\ 0): a \in \mathbb{R} \right\}\)).</description></item><item><title>Prof. Xin Liu</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhprof_xin_liu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhprof_xin_liu/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Project80</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproject80/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproject80/</guid><description>Project80 is a podcast hosted by Houjun Liu, Anoushka Krishnan, Micah Brown, Mia Tavares, among others.

If you have a differential equation of the shape:
\begin{equation} x^{&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;} = f(x,x&amp;rsquo;) \end{equation}
that, the second derivative is strictly a function between the first derivative value and the current value.

\begin{equation} a\dv[2]{x}{t} + b \dv{x}{t} + cx = 0 \end{equation}

To do this, we begin by making:

Finally, then, we can define a function \(P(k)\) for the \(k\) th state of our cell.

C strings don&amp;rsquo;t track their length; each C string always end in an null-terminating character: \0. This is represents the zero byte.
There&amp;rsquo;s a built in function strlen which checks the length of a string without the null-terminating character. This function is O(n)!!!

Task Estimation should be done each time!</description></item><item><title>taxicab norm</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtaxicab_norm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtaxicab_norm/</guid><description>The taxicab norm is a norm against a gridded system; it should follow the same properties of the norm, but not inner products.</description></item><item><title>Technology: baboon.jemoka.com</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtechnology_baboon_jemoka_com/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtechnology_baboon_jemoka_com/</guid><description>Hostname: baboon.jemoka.com

We can just flip each of the digit, and then add 1:
take \(0101\), invert it to get \(1010\) adding these two numbers will give you \(1111\). If we just added one more \(0001\), it will flip over to be \(0000\).

additional information never have a utility function that&amp;rsquo;s infinite If something has infinite utility, doing two of the good things is the same as doing one good thing, which is wrong.</description></item><item><title>value iteration</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhvalue_iteration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhvalue_iteration/</guid><description>We apply the Bellman Expectation Equation and selecting the utility that is calculated by taking the most optimal action given the current utility:
\begin{equation} U_{k+1}(s) = \max_{a} \qty(R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s&amp;rsquo;} T(s&amp;rsquo; | s,a) U_{k}(s&amp;rsquo;)) \end{equation}
This iterative process is called the Bellman backup, or Bellman update.
\begin{equation} U_1 \dots U_{k} \dots U^{*} \end{equation}
eventually will converge into the optimal value function. After which, we just extract the greedy policy from the utility to get a policy to use.</description></item><item><title>value iteration, in practice</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhvalue_iteration_in_practice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhvalue_iteration_in_practice/</guid><description>Say we have a system:
