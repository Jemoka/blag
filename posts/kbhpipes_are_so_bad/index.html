<meta name=description content="I, for sure, spend equal if not time writing the data flywheel code compared to architectural changes.
This has been bugging me for awhile, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to sit down and write about it until now. In my mind there are three things that makes coming up with a good take about this (and also implementing it) hard:

This may be a problem that&rsquo;s solved in much of the frontier labs (I would argue more because of workflow optimizations that sidestep the problem, see below)
The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to the problem also seem extremely person-dependent, so it seems hard to make an overall suggestion.
Many people write it off as &ldquo;necessary engineering&rdquo;

I don&rsquo;t purport to have a solution to the pipes problem here, but I want to spend a little time now to reflect about what I have been thinking about while spending days at the office writing pipes."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>
