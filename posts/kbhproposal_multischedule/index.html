In operations research, a key problem involves balancing limited and uncertain resources for the maximization of a specific business objective under constraints (such as budget or time). Approaches for this problem are frequently domain-specific due to the variability in design variables.
For simpler problems such as hub-and-spoke placement design, one can use proximity (i.e. distance) as a target, leading to clustering-based approaches ((Ruan et al. 2016)) which focuses on minimizing resource distance to solve a specific task. In others probes, however, clustering based approaches do not show a clear advantage due to the fact that they involve resource allocation decisions on a non-linear space (unlike physical space) subject also to non-linear constraints (unlike time)."><meta name=author content="Houjun Liu"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/global.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/syntax.css></head><body><div class=center-clearfix><header><span id=header-name onclick='window.location.href="/"' style=cursor:pointer>Houjun Liu</span><div id=socialpanel><a href=https://www.jemoka.com/search/ class=header-social id=header-search><i class="ic fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i></i></a>

Approaches for this problem are frequently domain-specific due to the variability in design variables.</p><p>For simpler problems such as hub-and-spoke placement design, one can use proximity (i.e. distance) as a target, leading to clustering-based approaches ((<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_6>Ruan et al. 2016</a>)) which focuses on minimizing resource distance to solve a specific task. In others probes, however, clustering based approaches do not show a clear advantage due to the fact that they involve resource allocation decisions on a non-linear space (unlike physical space) subject also to non-linear constraints (unlike time).</p><p>(<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_5>Luo et al. 2021</a>) provides a succinct summary of various approaches used for cloud computing optimization; a vast majority of problems in that domain can be qualified as &ldquo;resource allocation&rdquo; problems, whereby one seeks to maximize the ordering of specific renewable resources&rsquo; utilization to maximize uptime. This type of problem is also seen in hospital resource allocation ((<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_7>Visintin et al. 2017</a>))&mdash;whereby the finite (due to limited bedcount) and renewable (due to patients leaving/dying) resources are optimized for maximal throughput.</p><p>Approaches exist to mix scheduling-based optimization and resource based optimizations for specific domains such as disaster relief ((<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_1>Baxter, Wilborn Lagerman, and Keskinocak 2020</a>)). Yet, these approaches are generally much more widely adaptable than the specific domains on which they are applied.</p><p>As such, this proposal seeks to provide a formalization of combined scheduling and resource allocation problems, which the proposed project will seek to solve using a variety of approach and explore an application of this generic formulation through the task of executive time scheduling.</p><h2 id=formulation>Formulation</h2><p>We formalize the task of resource management as an optimization under uncertainty scheme. Critical to this formalization is the choice that the objective function of this formalization under <em>any</em> parameters is <strong>minimizing time</strong>&mdash;that is, unlike classic resource allocation tasks, we do not consider the maximization of throughput or utilization as an objective.</p><p>We make this decision informed by the fact that any resource allocation problem is either unsolvable completely (due to the resource being fundamentally constrained to perform a unit task), or solvable trivially without considering time (by simply allocating in a queue), while any scheduling problem naively already uses minimizing time spent as the optimization objective. Therefore, by minimizing for time, our solver should then optimize for secondary objectives such as utilization.</p><p>Further, we consider time to be absolute with respect to \(t^{(0)}\), the epoch. As such, we obtain an optimization problem that:</p><p>\begin{align}
\arg\min_{\theta}\ & t^{(f)}_{\theta} - t^{(0)}
\end{align}</p><p>To obtain \(t^{(f)}\), we create a temporal dependency relation through all <strong>objects</strong> (i.e. the design variables) within the system&mdash;in effect creating a Gantt chart upon which we perform our optimization (in effect, automating approaches such as (<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_3>Doolen and Van Aken 2016</a>)); the final timestamp of the dependency relation can then serve as our value for \(t^{(f)}\).</p><p>To support this formulation, therefore, we have to formalize every other secondary objective in terms of an <strong>object</strong> with a temporal dependency. To do this, we provide fundamental primitives here upon which a computations graph for \(t^{(f)}\) can be generated; the product of all parameters of the primitives used forms the design variable upon which optimization occurs.</p><h3 id=block>Block</h3><p>a &ldquo;block&rdquo; is a fixed region of time \((t_{1}, t_2)\) where \(t^{(0)} &lt; t_{1} &lt; t_2\) for which no other primitives can be scheduled. Its existance does not change \(t^{(f)}\).</p><h3 id=event>Event</h3><p>A event is a unit of work with fixed time window, each with a specific dispatch time and duration. If our schedule contains \(n\) events, we demand that \(t_{\theta}^{(f)} > t_{n}^{(1)}\) where \(t^{(1)}_{n}\) is the ending time of the last event.</p><p>If an event is scheduled atop a Block, its end time is increased by the duration of that block.</p><p>An event always exposes at least one design variable, dispatch time, which is when the event shall take place; further, it may expose any set of categorical parameters to choose from. Importantly, the <strong>duration</strong> of each event is neither a parameter nor a design variable in this system; it is a computed, <strong>random variable</strong> value (making this an optimization under uncertainty problem) of the design variables and schedule (due to resource allocation constraints). The Operationalization section below provides more details on this fact.</p><h3 id=task>Task</h3><p>A task is multiple events and tasks in dependent order, meaning each event must conclude when the other begins.</p><h3 id=schedule>Schedule</h3><p>A schedule is a combination of tasks and blocks which are internally dependent. In effect, our optimization problem becomes the act of choosing dispatch times of events which is allowable by the schedule.</p><p>\begin{align}
\arg\min_{\theta}\ & t^{(f)}_{\theta} - t^{(0)} \\
s.t.\ &\theta \in \text{schedule}
\end{align}</p><h2 id=operationalization>Operationalization</h2><p>We give here a sketch of two common resources which are allocated through optimization techniques, and how the framework outlined above allows them to be formalized.</p><h3 id=constrained-resource-allocation>Constrained Resource Allocation</h3><p>Consider the case where there are \(n\) possibly-divisible units of work to be completed by \(w\) workers. In the fashion outlined in ((<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_2>Cavalcante, Cardonha, and Herrmann 2013</a>)), each work unit \(n\) is considered a Task, subdivided into one to multiple Events based on the nature of the task.</p><p>To compute \(t_{2}\) of each event, we greedily ((<a href=#citeproc_bib_item_4>Lee et al. 2013</a>)) assign the event to the first available worker at that point, and, if a worker is not available, we add to \(t_2\) the wall time until the an worker becomes available. As such, the task of choosing the correct sequence of wall times becomes a proxy for allocating worker usage; for instance, if a task with a dependency needs to start earlier, moving other tasks&rsquo; dispatch times to when the dependent task started is a proxy for assigning the dependent task first to a worker.</p><h3 id=traffic-allocation>Traffic Allocation</h3><p>If a transportation task is needed, we formalize it as a single Event. This event has uncertain duration (due to traffic). The high-level choices of routing are exposed as a parameter to this event, while the details are computed directly and taken as oracle data.</p><h2 id=optimization>Optimization</h2><p>Tasks and their dependencies are an abstraction over the choices of a sequence of events. With a certain Event order chosen, one can solve the optimization problem with a two step, iterative approach.</p><ol><li>choose parameters: we formulate event &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; as categorical here, so its possible to perform simple grid search to choose parameters; if the parameter space is large, approximate bracketing approaches maybe sufficient to choose each parameter</li><li>optimization: using the method of dual numbers, we use the selected parameters to create a computation graph for \(t^{(f)}\) with uncertainty; this is our design objective for which we can use local model methods or direct methods to solve</li></ol><p>Once an optimal choice of \(2\) is obtained, we return to step \(1\), fixing our choices of dispatch times, for an reevaluation of parameters. We repeat until this scheme converges.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>For each Event, we provide an interface to compute its duration based on dispatch time and state (the other chosen dispatch times.) Event durations are computed left-to-right in order for all previous events of a computation to already have both an associated dispatch time and ending time.</p><style>.csl-entry{text-indent:-1.5em;margin-left:1.5em}</style><div class=csl-bib-body><div class=csl-entry><a id=citeproc_bib_item_1></a>Baxter, A.
