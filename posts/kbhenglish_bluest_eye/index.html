From what, where, or whom does this notion come? What effect does it have on the way one perceives the world? On the way others perceive an individual?</p><p>How does beauty (the acquisition of it, the lack of it, or the presence of it) determine one’s fate in America? Is beauty a necessarily fixed entity or does it fluctuate at the whim of society? How much or to what extent does one’s perception of beauty contribute to one’s sense of self-worth?</p><h2 id=quotes-bin>Quotes Bin</h2><h3 id=beauty>Beauty</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>Claudia</strong></strong>: I had only one desire: to dismember it. To see of what it was made, to discover the dearness, to find the beauty, the desirability that had escaped me, but apparently only me.</li><li><strong><strong>Pecola</strong></strong>: Thrown, in this way, into the binding conviction that only a miracle could relieve her, she would never know her beauty. She would see only what there was to see: the eyes of other people.</li><li><strong><strong>Maureen</strong></strong>: Maureen agreed. &ldquo;Ooooo yes. My mother told me that a girl named Audrey, she went to the beauty parlor where we lived before, and asked the lady to fix her hair like Hedy Lamarr’s, and the lady said, &lsquo;Yeah, when you grow some hair like Hedy Lamarr’s.&rsquo;&rdquo; She laughed long and sweet. (post pecola beat-up)</li><li><strong><strong>Pauline</strong></strong> (Polly): Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another—physical beauty. In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap.</li><li><strong><strong>Pauline</strong></strong> (Polly) cont&rsquo;d: She was never able, after her education in the movies, to look at a face and not assign it some category in the scale of absolute beauty, and the scale was one she absorbed in full from the silver screen.</li><li><strong><strong>Pauline</strong></strong> (Polly): More and more she neglected her house, her children, her man&mdash;&mldr;the dark edges that made the daily life with the Fishers lighter, more delicate, more lovely &mldr; Here she found beauty, order, cleanliness, and praise.</li><li><strong><strong>Pauline</strong></strong> (Polly): Pauline kept this order, this beauty, for herself, a private world, and never introduced it into her storefront, or to her children.</li><li><strong><strong>Cholly</strong></strong> after Aunt Death: The funeral banquet was a peal of joy after the thunderous beauty of the funeral. It was like a street tragedy with spontaneity tucked softly into the corners of a highly formal structure.</li><li><strong><strong>Soaphead Church</strong></strong>: He thought it was at once the most fantastic and the most logical petition he had ever received. Here was an ugly little girl asking for beauty. A surge of love and understanding swept through him, but was quickly replaced by anger.</li><li><strong><strong>Claudia</strong></strong> (reflecting on Pecola): All of our waste which we dumped on her and which she absorbed. And all of our beauty, which was hers first and which she gave to us.</li></ul><h3 id=eyes>Eyes</h3><ul><li><strong><strong>a</strong></strong>: Her eyes are full of sorrow. She sings to me: &ldquo;When the deep purple falls over sleepy garden walls, someone thinks of me&mldr;.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>**</strong></li></ul><h2 id=sub-claim-synthesis>Sub-Claim Synthesis</h2><hr><p>There&rsquo;s always the <a href=https://wp.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UWC_handouts_What-How-So-What-Thesis-revised-5-4-15-RZ.pdf>UCLA Writing Lab</a>.</p></div></article></main><footer><p id=footer>&copy; 2019-2022 Houjun Liu.
