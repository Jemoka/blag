Instead, then, we just make them bigger and control them at the same time. We can implement gates via a sequence of pulses. If you work with interacting qubits a lot, you will end up with the APR Paradox.
If you take two qubits, and move them though two gates, you essentially will get entangled results.
To make this works, you will need to take some probability.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</guid><description> \(A\) does all the asking, \(B\) has all the decision making power Population \(A\)&amp;rsquo;s match never goes up at best, they stay the same Population \(B\)&amp;rsquo;s match can never go down.

Given a proportion \(\hat{p}\) (&amp;ldquo;95% of sample), the range which would possibly contain it as part of its \(2\sigma\) range is the \(95\%\) confidence interval.
Therefore, given a \(\hat{p}\) the plausible interval for its confidence is:
