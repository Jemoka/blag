Instead, then, we just make them bigger and control them at the same time. We can implement gates via a sequence of pulses. If you work with interacting qubits a lot, you will end up with the APR Paradox.
If you take two qubits, and move them though two gates, you essentially will get entangled results.
To make this works, you will need to take some probability.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</guid><description> \(A\) does all the asking, \(B\) has all the decision making power Population \(A\)&amp;rsquo;s match never goes up at best, they stay the same Population \(B\)&amp;rsquo;s match can never go down.

Consider two populations, \(A\) and \(B\), who want to form paired relationships between a person \(A\) and \(B\). \(A_i\) has a list of their ranked order matches (I want to be paired with \(B_1\) most, \(B_4\) second, etc.), and so does \(B_i\) (I want to be paired with \(A_4\) most \(A_9\) second, etc.)

The purpose of AIBridge is to bridge the gap between computer science and other disciplines. To many, working with AI might seem like an unreachable objective. However, in reality, one week is enough to get started. AIBridge will provide basic programming capability in Python and knowledge of object-oriented programming as well as the concepts behind machine learning and how to implement it using a popular toolbox, Scikit-Learn.</description></item><item><title>AIBridge Final Project</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_final_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_final_project/</guid><description>Part 1: ML Training Practice One of the things that makes a very good Sommelier is their ability to figure out as much details about a wine as possible with very little information.

Also, you have a &amp;ldquo;flavor-ater&amp;rdquo; machine that makes a linear combination of multiple chemical features together (similar to PCA), which is counted as one chemical feature after combination.</description></item><item><title>AIBridge Iris Variance Worksheet</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_iris_variance_worksheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaibridge_iris_variance_worksheet/</guid><description>SPOILER ALERT for future labs!!

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris Then, we simply execute the following to load the data.

We know that \(O(n\ log\ n)\) is between \(O(n)\) and \(O(n^2)\) &amp;mdash; so we can roughly call it &amp;ldquo;polynomial time.&amp;rdquo;
Since the optimal comparison cannot be faster than polynomial time, we say that comparison-based sorting is a polynomial-time algorithm.
From this information, we can come up with two main time classes: \(P\) for solutions with known polynomial time, \(NP\) for non-deterministic polynomial time.</description></item><item><title>composite system</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcomposite_system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcomposite_system/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ConDef Abstract</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcondef_abstract/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhcondef_abstract/</guid><description>Current automated lexicography (term definition) techniques cannot include contextual or new term information as a part of its synthesis.

constructor theory can give us a theory of the universal quantum constructor by expanding upon quantum information theory.

Through the utilisation of parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) which processes variable n-grams of text 15, 20, and 25 tokens in length encoded by Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), the complexities of linguistic content on social platforms are effectively captured and analysed.

Examples include
t-test (for sample means) z-test (for sample proportions) chi-square test (for sample categories) Common to all hypothesis tests are the following terms.

While theory education is crucial, much of academic science takes place via scrutinizing contested scientific discourse. Due to such resources’ content complexity, high school students are rarely exposed to current, debatable, and relevant science. In response, we introduce Project80: a systemic, student-run protocol to synthesize the latest primary literature in a sub-field into approachable, produced multimedia educational content. The protocol is run by a team of 7 students over the course of 1 month.</description></item><item><title>Projects Index</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhprojects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhprojects/</guid><description>Projects Index is a index that contains a list of almost all projects for which I have ever worked on.

Novelty Instead of just looking at actual speech content, look at pauses specific as a feature engineering task \(89.6\%\) on the ADReSS Challenge dataset Notable Methods Applied FA with pause encoding with standard .cha semantics (short pauses, medium pauses, long pauses). Shoved all of this into an ERNIE.

Before it can be conducted, it must meet the conditions for inference for a z-test.
conditions for inference (z-test) has to be random has to be reasonably normal (vis a vi test for normality) each sample has to be independent (or 10% rule) use a z-statistic to find p-value Given a sample proportion, calculate the sample proportion standard deviation (given on the formula sheet) Then, divide the difference between measured and null proportions to figure \(z\) that is,</description></item><item><title>zettlekasten</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhzettlekasten/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhzettlekasten/</guid><description>A zettlekasten is an atomic notetaking system.</description></item><item><title>zettlekasten index</title><link>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhzettlekasten_index/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jemoka.com/posts/kbhzettlekasten_index/</guid><description>a zettlekasten index is an index in a zettlekasten file format; it keeps track of all lists of notes.

One-Liner late fusion of multimodal signal on the CTP task using transformers, mobilnet, yamnet, and mockingjay
Novelty Similar to Martinc 2021 and Shah 2021 but actually used the the current Neural-Network state of the art Used late fusion again after the base model training Proposed that inconsistency in the diagnoses of MMSE scores could be a great contributing factor to multi-task learning performance hindrance Notable Methods Proposed base model for transfer learning from text based on MobileNet (image), YAMNet (audio), Mockingjay (speech) and BERT (text) Data all sourced from recording/transcribing/recognizing CTP task Key Figs Figure 3 and 4 This figure tells us the late fusion architecture used</description></item></channel></rss>
