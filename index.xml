Instead, then, we just make them bigger and control them at the same time. We can implement gates via a sequence of pulses. If you work with interacting qubits a lot, you will end up with the APR Paradox.
If you take two qubits, and move them though two gates, you essentially will get entangled results.
To make this works, you will need to take some probability.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpoint_estimate/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhproperties_of_the_stable_matching_algorithm/</guid><description> \(A\) does all the asking, \(B\) has all the decision making power Population \(A\)&amp;rsquo;s match never goes up at best, they stay the same Population \(B\)&amp;rsquo;s match can never go down.

Consider two populations, \(A\) and \(B\), who want to form paired relationships between a person \(A\) and \(B\). \(A_i\) has a list of their ranked order matches (I want to be paired with \(B_1\) most, \(B_4\) second, etc.), and so does \(B_i\) (I want to be paired with \(A_4\) most \(A_9\) second, etc.)

Studies indicate that cold exposure cold exposure can activate AgRP (stimulate food intake) as a means for the brain leveraging CNS regulation to which would lower the glucose level and maintain glucose homeostatis.
However, cold exposure also trigger energy expenditure, and seems contradictory but not really why?.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhz_score/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhz_score/</guid><description/></item><item><title>AAA</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaaa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaaa/</guid><description/></item><item><title>action of Capecitabmine</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaction_of_capecitabmine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaction_of_capecitabmine/</guid><description>Capecitabmine =&amp;gt; 5-Fluoropyrimidine =&amp;gt; Cancer cell death.</description></item><item><title>action research</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaction_research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhaction_research/</guid><description/></item><item><title>active recall</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhactive_recall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhactive_recall/</guid><description/></item><item><title>ADHD</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhadhd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhadhd/</guid><description/></item><item><title>adMe</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhadme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhadme/</guid><description>adMe: absorbtion, distribution, metabolism, excretion.

constructor theory can give us a theory of the universal quantum constructor by expanding upon quantum information theory. It allows us to unify quantum and classical information by simply defining operations in terms of counterfactuals exclusively: that a space is entirely defined by what&amp;rsquo;s possible and what&amp;rsquo;s not possible.

The core logic of hypothesis testing: have a metric, do tests, calculate probability that the outcome could have happened given the metric is true.
Examples include
t-test (for sample means) z-test (for sample proportions) chi-square test (for sample categories) Common to all hypothesis tests are the following terms.
null hypothesis A null hypothesis is a &amp;ldquo;no difference&amp;rdquo; hypothesis created as a part of hypothesis testing.</description></item><item><title>Index</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhindex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhindex/</guid><description>Master Indexes The KB is a zettlekasten, a connected series of notes that are atomic and links ideas together.

It is mostly links to other resources that would help.
Introductory Remarks Nobody &amp;ldquo;learns&amp;rdquo; software development. Even in job interviews, people expect you to have &amp;ldquo;worked&amp;rdquo; in software development. The industry, as a whole, drives via &amp;ldquo;learn-by-doing&amp;rdquo;, so its best to start thinking about what you want to achieve with software dev in terms of projects, then look specifically for resources to help you achieve those.</description></item><item><title>Soviet Perspective on Cold War</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhsoviet_perspective_on_cold_war/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhsoviet_perspective_on_cold_war/</guid><description>Reading notes Because feeling for self-endowment, they wish to build socialist society As Communists considered themselves as a vanguard of the revolutionary proletariat – their “aim” was to build socialist society in the whole world.

\begin{equation} statistic \pm z^*\sigma_{statistic} \end{equation}
Frequently, we don&amp;rsquo;t have access to \(\sigma\) and hence have to guestimate. When we have a sample means and a proportion, we have ways of guestimating it from the standard error (available on the single-sample section of the AP Statistics formula sheet.)
However, for means, the standard error involves! \(\sigma\). How do we figure \(\sigma\) when we don&amp;rsquo;t know it? We could use \(s\), sample standard deviation, but then we have to adjust \(z^*\) otherwise we will have underestimation.</description></item><item><title>t-test</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbht_test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbht_test/</guid><description>A t-test is a hypothesis test for statistical significance between two sample means based on t-statistics.

that number of successes and failures need both be greater than or equal to ten.</description></item><item><title>therma</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtherma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtherma/</guid><description/></item><item><title>universal quantum constructor</title><link>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhuniversal_quantum_constructor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhuniversal_quantum_constructor/</guid><description>A constructor built out of quantum theory which can replicate itself.
