iStudio!
Oh boy. So much to say. Y'all have got it all down: coaching kids through design thinking, starting teams, recruiting new blood, and absolutely killing it during Demo Day. I feel indescribably privileged to call you all partners in running this gargantuan operation.
Charlotte, your incredible mastery of communication is a sight to behold. You are a giant in dealing with human beings, in managing relationships, and someone that I respect and look up to in terms of learning how best to survive our deeply human world. Never loose this; continue to be a people person person, and applying that unique skill of yours combined with your big brain and equally big heart to make the Studio and the world a better place.
Logan, you are a taskmaster, a leader, and the super-glue of many Nueva-clubs. You naturally pivot between different contexts without breaking a sweat, all while making your team members feel a signature charm. Keep rallying our teams together, and keep rallying your tribe in and out of the Studio: it is that deep connection with the community that makes you a powerful person.
I know for a fact throughout the last 2(~ish) years, I may have made many mistakes: been harsh at times, been perhaps careless or absent. Please accept my apologies for these scenarios; please continue to provide feedback to me, and continue to tell me what is going on in your lives. Working with you lightened my Nueva career, and our conversations continue to make me a better person.

Please don't be a stranger: https://www.jemoka.com/card.txt

Thank you.
