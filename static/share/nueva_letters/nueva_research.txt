Hi friends,
Building R@N has been one of the most amazingly unique privledges I had the fortune of participating in at Nueva; thank you all for being such an integral part of this journey.
I still remember our first kick-off meeting: we were deer in the headlights---some kids with a vague direction and absolute confusion. Flash forward a year, we are running arguably one of the most pioneering pedagogy development programs across the country.... and still have absolute confusion. :facepalm:
Throughout this time of move-fast-and-break-things, I have seen each and every one of you maximize yourselves and flick through multiple, incredible roles---all at once!
Michael, thank you for gluing the team together, for being the stick behind all of us: putting your signature humor against your unwavering leadership to push the program forward.
Kian, thank you for always being the first to jump to opportunities, to always have a hunger for more, and for chasing ahead of everyone to both push boundaries forward---all while having time to help others selflessly.
Oliver, thank you for being a master of all trades: taking your breathtakingly diverse skillset and applying it all across and beyond the program. You have left an indelible mark on the culture and product of this team.
Vinca, thank you for being the voice of sanity, for guiding us all back to the proverbial light of reason even as we spewn strange ideas and even worse implementations.
Max, thank you for being a taskmaster, for pushing yourself to innovate on our program, and to breaking expectations and rules just slight enough to make creative sparkles through the team.
Not only do I leave R@N with hope, I leave with great gratitude. I am not the best communicator at times, and can definitely be a source of unfounded stress even when none is warranted. Thank you for putting up with me, and for continuing to provide me fedeback when I am unclear or just good ol' fashion misguided. Thank you for sticking with R@N, despite the program dangling from death more than once. I'm super excited to see what you all build next.

As always, please don't be a stranger: https://www.jemoka.com/card.txt
