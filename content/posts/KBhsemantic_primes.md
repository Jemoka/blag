In [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}), [semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}}) are the most fundimental "lexical units" (so they can be words, or morphemes, etc. the _size_ doesn't matter) across languages.

They are the "core of a universal mental lexicon".

There are...


## guidelines for identifying [semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}}) {#guidelines-for-identifying-semantic-primes--kbhsemantic-primes-dot-md}

1.  A [semantic prime]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}}) has to be found in every(ish?) natural language
2.  A [semantic prime]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}}) has to be indefinable by other primes

1.  the list has grown over time
2.  the problem of ****[allolexy](#problems-with-semantic-prime--kbhsemantic-primes-dot-md--s)****: formal restrictions of a language resulting in the same concept needing to be radicalized multiple times (I vs. me)

According to (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Geeraerts 2009</a>), (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Goddard 2009</a>) provides a "practical" (though flawed) way of establishing primes.
