This is such a weird definition (i.e. defining finite-demensional without defining basis/linear independence/etc.etc.) but!

&gt; will come back to update this definition later.

A [finite-dimensional vector space]({{< relref "KBhfinite_dimensional_vector_space.md" >}}) is a [vector space]({{< relref "KBhvector_space.md" >}}) where some actual list (which remember, has finite length) of vectors [spans]({{< relref "KBhspan.md#spans" >}}) the space.
