[Tuning Forks]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) (funing torks!) is a [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}). You smack it and it goes "biiing!"

Let's figure out how it works. For us to be one same page, let's define some vocab:


## Vocab {#vocab}

-   "Tine": one of the two prongs of the fork


## A Cursory Explanation {#a-cursory-explanation}

Source: (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">“Smithsonian - Tuning Forks” 2022</a>) (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">“How Tuning Forks Work” 2011</a>)

From a very basic perspective, hiting a tuning fork creates a transverse wave on the tine you hit, which vibrates and then compresses the air around it in a longitudinal fashion at a set frequency, which we hear as a sound.

Ok but then this raises the question of why there's two tines. The explanation this website gives is essentially that the actual mechanism of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) is in squishing the air **immediately around** the fork, so...

1.  if the tines are push towards together, it creates a void in the space it just was; this creates a low pressure ****rarefaction**** area
2.  if the tines snap back apart, it compresses the air creating ****compression**** by squishing the air around it

And therefore, the air around the [funing tork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) is essentially being played like a two-way slingy. To adjust the pitch of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}), you lengthen or shorten it: longer tuning forks have larger tines, which vibrate more slowly.


## Ok but now many, many questions {#ok-but-now-many-many-questions}

1.  why does smacking one side of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) make both sides vibrate
2.  presumably the base is not vibrating; hence, how does the downward-bendy vibration cause perpendicular oscillation (does it?)
