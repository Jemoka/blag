[Tuning Forks]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) (funing torks!) is a [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}). You smack it and it goes "biiing!"

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-08-27_14-02-11_screenshot.png" >}}

Let's figure out how it works. For us to be one same page, let's define some vocab:


## Vocab {#vocab}

-   "Tine": one of the two prongs of the fork


## A Cursory Explanation {#a-cursory-explanation}

Source: [here](https://science.howstuffworks.com/tuning-fork2.htm) and [here](https://americanhistory.si.edu/science/tuningfork.htm). Both are not very scientific but a good first step.

From a very basic perspective, hiting a tuning fork creates a transverse wave on the tine you hit, which vibrates and then compresses the air around it in a longitudinal fashion at a set frequency, which we hear as a sound.

Ok but then this raises the question of why there's two tines. The explanation this website gives is essentially that the actual mechanism of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) is in squishing the air **immediately around** the fork, so...

1.  if the tines are push towards together, it creates a void in the space it just was; this creates a low pressure ****rarefaction**** area
2.  if the tines snap back apart, it compresses the air creating ****compression**** by squishing the air around it

And therefore, the air around the [funing tork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) is essentially being played like a two-way slingy. To adjust the pitch of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}), you lengthen or shorten it: longer tuning forks have larger tines, which vibrate more slowly.


## Ok but now many, many questions {#ok-but-now-many-many-questions}

1.  why does smacking one side of the [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}}) make both sides vibrate
2.  presumably the base is not vibrating; hence, how does the downward-bendy vibration cause perpendicular oscillation (does it?)


## A Detour on Rigid Body Harmonic Motion {#a-detour-on-rigid-body-harmonic-motion}

Let's talk about [Bending.
]({{< relref "KBhbending.md" >}})

1.  How does this relate to springs/slinkies? [read this.](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Young_s_Modulus_Spring_Constant.html)


## A Detour on the Temperature {#a-detour-on-the-temperature}

We are really worried about two different things here.

1.  Metal expands/contracts based on the temperature
2.  Temperature affects speed of sound

## Why are our [Tuning Fork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}})s out of tune? {#why-are-our-tuning-fork--kbhtuning-forks-dot-md--s-out-of-tune}


## Fun, Relevant Factoids About the World {#fun-relevant-factoids-about-the-world}

-   The range of human hearing from a youngen is about 20Hz to 20,000Hz.


## Look into {#look-into}

-   Young's Modulus
    -   Density
    -   Second
-   overtones: six and a quarter; why?
-   why no free vibrations just standing?
-   prove the equations given in [Rossing 1990]({{< relref "KBhrossing_1990.md" >}})
-   why do high frequencies die faster?
