The [nsm]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) theory is a theory that...

1.  claims that there exists a set of semantic primes and logic universal across languages which is indefinable by other words within the language
2.  which, as a corollary, resolves the epistemological problem that if all words are defined by other words in the language there will (why?) be no connection to the real world

the theory of [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) rests on...


## two pillars of [NSM]({{< relref "KBhnatural_semantic_metalanguage.md" >}}) theory {#two-pillars-of-nsm--kbhnatural-semantic-metalanguage-dot-md--theory}

1.  existence of [semantic primes]({{< relref "KBhsemantic_primes.md" >}})
2.  the ability to perform the act of [reductive paraphrase]({{< relref "KBhreductive_paraphrase.md" >}})
