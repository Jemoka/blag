[electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}) is analogous to [gravitational potential energy]({{< relref "KBhgravitational_potential_energy.md" >}}), but with electrostatics!

\begin{equation}
P\_{E} = qV
\end{equation}

where \\(q\\) is the change on the particle in question, and \\(V\\) is the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}), the difference in [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}) between two places.

Yes, [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}) is defined vis a vi [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}): that is, it represents a _differential_ of [electric potential]({{< relref "KBhelectric_potential_energy.md" >}}).

Let \\(A, B, C\\) be positrons, and the lines are the [electric field]({{< relref "KBhelectric_field.md" >}}). Which one has the highest electric potential? \\(A\\), because it has the most distance to travel to until it can get all the way to the right.
