4 years?!?!?

**HOW?**

Peter---what can you _not_ do? Your cool and thoughtful leadership make JC and FRC happen, your intelligence and precision make XRT and Longitude what they are. Your sheer drive in every single day humble me; it is _infectious_.

Thank you for being the voice of reason, for staying so cool under pressure, and for many times keeping my sheer mania in check.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
