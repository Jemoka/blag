## Waterfall {#waterfall}

The waterfall specification gets written before any code written. We hand off spec and code directly to tester, and code should behave like spec.

-   Code specification exactly
-   Spec does not update

Code happens only after stuff is done


## Agile {#agile}

[Agile](#agile) are designed to work with minimum specification before code. Spec is updated constantly as code changes and get user feedback.
