[quantum information theory]({{< relref "KBhquantum_information_theory.md" >}}) requires manipulating counterfactual information---not what the current known states are, but what are the _next possible states_.

Inside [physics]({{< relref "KBhphysics.md" >}}), there is already a few principles which are counterfactual.

1.  Conservation of energy: a perpetual machine is **\*impossible**
2.  Second law: its ****impossible**** to convert all heat into useful work
3.  Heisenberg's uncertainty: its ****impossible**** to copy reliable all states of a qubit

With the impossibles, we can make the possible.
