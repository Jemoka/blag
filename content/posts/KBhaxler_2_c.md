## Key Sequence {#key-sequence}


## New Definitions {#new-definitions}

-   [dimension]({{< relref "KBhdimension.md" >}})


## Results and Their Proofs {#results-and-their-proofs}

-   [Length of Basis Doesn't Depend on Basis]({{< relref "KBhlength_of_basis_doesn_t_depend_on_basis.md" >}})
-   lists of right length are [basis]({{< relref "KBhbasis.md" >}})
    -   [linearly independent list of length dim V are a basis of V]({{< relref "KBhdimension.md#linearly-independent-list-of-length-dim-v-are-a-basis-of-v" >}})


## Questions for Jana {#questions-for-jana}

-   Example 2.41: why is it that \\(\dim U \neq 4\\)? We only know that \\(\dim \mathcal{P}\_{3}(\mathbb{R}) = 4\\), and \\(\dim U \leq 4\\). Is it because \\(U\\) (i.e. [basis]({{< relref "KBhbasis.md" >}}) of \\(U\\) doesn't [span]({{< relref "KBhspan.md" >}}) the polynomial) is strictly a subset of \\(\mathcal{P}\_{3}(\mathbb{R})\\), so there must be _some_ extension needed?
