## Learning Goals {#learning-goals}

1.  Effective modern methods for deep NLP
    -   Word vectors, FFNN, recurrent networks, attention
    -   Transformers, encoder/decoder, pre-training, post-training (RLHF, SFT), adaptation, interoperability, agents
2.  Big picture in HUMAN LANGUAGES
    -   why are they hard
    -   why using computers to deal with them are doubly hard
3.  Making stuff (in PyTorch)
    -   word meaning
    -   dependency parsing
    -   machine translation
    -   QA
