Thank you Vinca,

Thank you so much for sticking through with R@N through its many thicks and thins; thank you for your leadership---always providing a cool voice of reason and direction through all of the often manic and unpredictable changes. Thank you for creating the systems that allowed the team to happen: our team cannot be where it is without you.

I am humbled by your depth of knowledge, and your consistent willingness to share it with others. I am super excited to dive head-first into QuantumNLP. I can't wait to see what we create next together. Thank you for making the amazing happen.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
