Hello Michael,

Your slice! You dice! You are a taskmaster that make R@N run, you are the leader that power Ferrofoot, you are the voice that sets the tone in JC. What more can I ask for in a collaborator? It has been my privilege to learn from how you think, how you lead, and how you make a lasting mark in any room you grace.

Seriously. Thank you for making it all happen, and for keeping the same trademark sense of punchy levity that makes it all fun and worthwhile.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
