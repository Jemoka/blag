[Deterministic Finite Automata]({{< relref "KBhdeterministic_finite_automata.md" >}}), [Nondeterministic Finite Automata]({{< relref "KBhnondeterministic_finite_automata.md" >}}) and [regular expression]({{< relref "KBhregular_expression_complexity.md" >}})s


## Streaming Algorithms {#streaming-algorithms}

[Streaming Algorithms](#streaming-algorithms) are computation that grow with the size of the input at a "small"(?) rate.

[Streaming Algorithms](#streaming-algorithms) is a superset of [DFA]({{< relref "KBhdeterministic_finite_automata.md" >}})s: things that [Streaming Algorithms](#streaming-algorithms) can't do can't also be done with [DFA]({{< relref "KBhdeterministic_finite_automata.md" >}})s. Their memory doesn't grow too large against the sizes of strings.


### [communication]({{< relref "KBhsu_engr76_may072024.md#communication" >}}) {#communication--kbhsu-engr76-may072024-dot-md}

we lastly consider [communication]({{< relref "KBhsu_engr76_may072024.md#communication" >}}), as a limited-resource thing that [Streaming Algorithms](#streaming-algorithms) can solve. we also consider impossibility results from [communication]({{< relref "KBhsu_engr76_may072024.md#communication" >}}) to give us impossibilities with [Streaming Algorithms](#streaming-algorithms).
