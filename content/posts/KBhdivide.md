Division!


## constituents {#constituents}

-   integers \\(a, b\\)


## requirements {#requirements}

\\(b\\) is said to [divide]({{< relref "KBhdivide.md" >}}) \\(a\\) if there is some integer \\(q\\) such that:

\begin{equation}
a = qb
\end{equation}

This is written as: \\(b|a\\).


## additional information {#additional-information}


### greatest common divisor {#greatest-common-divisor}

See also [greatest common divisor]({{< relref "KBhgreatest_common_divisor.md" >}})


### division algorithm {#division-algorithm}

For \\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\\), with \\(b>0\\), there is some unique \\(q, r\\) such that \\(a = qb+r\\), where \\(0 \leq r < b\\).

We call \\(q\\) the [quotient](#division-algorithm) and \\(r\\) the [remainder](#division-algorithm).
