Charlotte,

HOLY CRAP! Its been almost a whole year... The Studio has come a _looong_ way since you and Logan took the helm, and I daresay it is going to places far beyond what I could have done.

Thank you for being the cool thinker even despite my mania, for being the direct and effective communicator. Your people skills humble me and are a goalstone from which I am still far from achieving.

Thank you for the opportunity to be your friend and your collaborator, and for your leadership making it all happen.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
