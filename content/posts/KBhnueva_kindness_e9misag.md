Misha---

Thank you for always being there, for bringing Menlo Park together, and for being the voice of reason even despite my many maniacal machinations.

Thank you for making life at Nueva and beyond fun, and for being so always kind and supportive throughout the last four years for which I had the privilege of knowing you.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
