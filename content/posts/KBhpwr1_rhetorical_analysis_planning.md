## Claim Synthesis {#claim-synthesis}


### Quotes Bin {#quotes-bin}


####  {#d41d8c}

“And then there are these additional intellectual questions. Can AI, without robust common sense, be truly safe for humanity? And is brute-force scale really the only way and even the correct way to teach AI? So I’m often asked these days whether it's even feasible to do any meaningful research without extreme-scale compute.”

double intentre: "intellectual" as in interesting but also "intellectual" as in worth asking


####  {#d41d8c}

“Perhaps we can draw an analogy from "David and Goliath," here, Goliath being the extreme-scale language models, and seek inspiration from an old-time classic, "The Art of War," which tells us, in my interpretation, know your enemy, choose your battles, and innovate your weapons.”

Importing the language of war---raising urgency and stakes. Animating: more strongly dynamic.


####  {#d41d8c}

“AI today is unbelievably intelligent and then shockingly stupid.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=3&amp;annotation=35JSUAXU)) phrasing: contrast

adv adj and then adv adj

Raises stakes: uses the language of extremes


####  {#d41d8c}

“brute-force scale.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=3&amp;annotation=WYUT9PDZ))

another language of extreme wc: "brute"


####  {#d41d8c}

“Some scale optimists might say, “Don’t worry about this. All of these can be easily fixed by adding similar examples as yet more training data for AI." But the real question is this. Why should we even do that?”

contrast: some ... we—us them dynamic


####  {#d41d8c}

“And that AI decided to kill humans to utilize them as additional resources, to turn you into paper clips.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=3&amp;annotation=25H9C3MG)) humans ... you—increase urgency


####  {#d41d8c}

“We’ve been told that it’s a research topic of ’70s and ’80s; shouldn’t work on it because it will never work; in fact, don't even say the word to be taken seriously.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=4&amp;annotation=97H3RG7L)) dropping subject; "we"—raises urgency by highlighting contrast


####  {#d41d8c}

“We don't know what's in this, but it should be open and publicly available so that we can inspect and ensure [it supports] diverse norms and values.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=5&amp;annotation=8ENT9PEL)) repeated usage of "we"—bilding a tride


####  {#d41d8c}

“We're now entering a new era in which AI is almost like a new intellectual species with unique strengths and weaknesses compared to humans. In order to make this powerful AI sustainable and humanistic, we need to teach AI common sense, norms and values.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W8C8UZWS?page=6&amp;annotation=DLXMRF8U)) anthropormorphising
