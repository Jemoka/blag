## Gaussian Elimination Quiz: 09/20/2022 {#gaussian-elimination-quiz-09-20-2022}

-   Demonstrate that matrices' multiplication are not commutative (error: didn't consider \\(m\times m\\))
-   Which \\(2\times 2\\) matrices under multiplication form a group? (error: closure need to proved on **invertable** matrices under multiplication, not just \\(2\times 2\\))
-   Deriving Rotation matrices (error: clockwise vs counter-clockwise)


## Linear Independence Quiz {#linear-independence-quiz}

-   Connection between linear independence and systems equations (error: beated around the bush) --- the matrix of an nxn system of equations has a solution if the matrix's column vectors is linearly independent


## Basis and Dimension Quiz {#basis-and-dimension-quiz}

-   put 0 into a basis AAAA not lin. indep; figure out what the basis for a polynomial with a certain root is: it is probably of dimension m (instead of m+1), because scalars doesn't work in the case of p(3)=0; so basis is just the scalars
-   missing some inequality about basis? --- its just that lin.idp sets is shorter or equal to basis and spanning sets is longer or equal to basis
