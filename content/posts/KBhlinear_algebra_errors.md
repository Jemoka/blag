-   Demonstrate that matrices' multiplication are not commutative (error: didn't consider \\(m\times m\\))
-   Which \\(2\times 2\\) matrices form a group? (error: closure need to proved on **invertable** matrices under multiplication, not just \\(2\times 2\\))
-   When is dot product \\(0\\)? (error: ok)
-   Geometric interpretations of cross product (error: ok?)
-   Rotation matrices (error: clockwise vs counter-clockwise)
