Based on the wise words of a crab, I will start writing down some [Proof Design Patterns]({{< relref "KBhproof_design_patterns.md" >}}) I saw over [Axler]({{< relref "KBhlinear_algebra_index.md" >}}).

-   [combining, comutting, splitting]({{< relref "KBhcomplex_number.md#insights-combining-and-splitting" >}})
-   [construct then generalize]({{< relref "KBhcomplex_number.md#insights-construct-then-generalize" >}}) for uniqueness and existence
-   [try to remember to go backwards]({{< relref "KBhcomplex_number.md#insights-try-to-remember-to-go-backwards" >}})
