[Projects Index]({{< relref "KBhprojects.md" >}}) is a [index]({{< relref "KBhzettlekasten_index.md" >}}) that contains a list of almost all projects for which I have ever worked on. Major categories are highlighted from chapter titles.

****This index does not include my jobs****; it is meant to be a list of endeavors for which I had key designing or founding impact---not including many paid-jobs with an existing structure but including small one-off scripts and utilities; for my jobs and volunteering background, please [checkout my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/houjun-liu/).


## Research Projects {#research-projects}

I have spent the last 6 years or so working as an actively-publishing member of the science research community; my research interests are mainly in NLP, semantic analysis, L2 learning, and science education. As a part of my work with Professor [Brian Macwinney]({{< relref "KBhbrian_macwinney.md" >}}), I have also recently taken up interest in acoustic modeling.

For a list of my recent research, please head to the [Research Index]({{< relref "KBhresearch_index.md" >}}).


## Media Production Projects {#media-production-projects}

I produce a lot of media (videos, podcasts, blogs, live events/talks) as a part of publicizing my work or for other purposes. For those types of projects, head on over to [Production Index]({{< relref "KBhproduction_index.md" >}}).
