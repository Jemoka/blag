[Projects Index]({{< relref "KBhprojects.md" >}}) contains a list of almost all projects for which I have ever worked on. Major categories are highlighted from chapter titles. Of course, [research projects]({{< relref "KBhresearch_index.md" >}}) and [media projects]({{< relref "KBhproduction_index.md" >}}) are also projects, but because of the fact that they are more specific categories of work for which I am engaged in, they are counted separately.
