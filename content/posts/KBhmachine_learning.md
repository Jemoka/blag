[machine learning]({{< relref "KBhmachine_learning.md" >}}) is the act of using some input to come up with some prediction, where the model is parameterized via a bunch of [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s. Hence, [parameter learning]({{< relref "KBhparameter_learning.md" >}}) approaches is how machine learning works.
