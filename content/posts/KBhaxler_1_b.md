## Questions for Jana {#questions-for-jana}

-   The way Axler presented the idea of "over" is a tad weird; is it really only scalar multiplication which hinders vector spaces without \\(\mathbb{F}\\)? In other words, do the sets that form vector spaces, apart from the \\(\lambda\\) used for scalar multiplication, need anything to do with the \\(\mathbb{F}\\) they are "over"?
-   If lists have finite length \\(n\\), then what are the elements of \\(\mathbb{F}^{\infty}\\) called?
-   what's that thing called again in proofs where you just steal the property of a constituent element?


## Interesting Factoids {#interesting-factoids}

-   The simplest vector space is \\(\\{0\\}\\)
