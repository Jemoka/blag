###  {#d41d8c}

“Recent years have seen a sharp increase in political polarization in the United States (1–7), leading to deadlock in Congress (8), distorted beliefs about fellow Americans (9, 10), and distrust, hostility, and even violence toward outgroup members (11–13)” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 1]


###  {#d41d8c}

“pecifically, we focus on expressions that make claims about a category as a whole (e.g., “Democrats want to defund the police” makes a claim about the category of “Democrats”), also known as generics (34–38).” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 2]


###  {#d41d8c}

“A second distinctive signature of generics documented in prior research is that they tend to be how generalizations are later recalled, even when generalizations are stated in more precise, quantified ways” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 2]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Respondents showed a strong pattern of accepting generics for the target party and rejecting generics for the opposite party.” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 3]


###  {#d41d8c}

“We found that perceived polarization was greater than actual polarization, in two key respects: 1) for nearly every issue, people believed that the two parties were further apart than they actually are, and 2) patterns of generic endorsement were more polarized (i.e., revealed a greater gap between the two parties) than perceptions of prevalence.” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 5]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Generic acceptances depart from prevalence estimates in diverging ways: When taking prevalence estimates as the baseline, generics are accepted more frequently for targets, and less frequently for opposites. Additionally, the size of the gap between prevalence estimates for target vs. opposite items predicts endorsement of the target generic, and rejection of the opposite generic.” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 6]


###  {#d41d8c}

“A second signature of generic language is that it is privileged in people’s memory.” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 6]


###  {#d41d8c}

“The results of this study support the conclusion that generic language leads to polarized judgments regarding political parties, and does so more than nongeneric language. We obtained three key results: 1) for generic statements (e.g., “Democrats ...”), prevalence estimates were larger for the named party (e.g., Democrats, when the generic statement was about Democrats) than for the unnamed party (e.g., Republicans, when the generic statement was about Democrats); 2) for generic statements, prevalence estimates were above 50% for the named party and below 50% for the unnamed party; and 3) the gap between named and unnamed prevalence estimates was larger for generic statements than for nongeneric statements (such as “Many Democrats support House Bill 858” or “Some Democrats support House Bill 858”).” [Novoa et al., 2023, p. 9]

“Although causal interpretation is beyond the scope of this paper, and much more research is needed, we see our evidence as consistent with an autonomous effect of elite political discourse on congressional speech and legislative gr” [“Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]”


###  {#d41d8c}

“? The predominant view in political science is that the current polarization in Congress has not diffused much into the citizenry” [“Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]”, 2024, p. 5]


###  {#d41d8c}

“). The idea that U.S. politics is necessarily polarized, owing to the intrinsic diversity and size of the country, goes back at least to James Madison and the divergence between Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian economic philosophies” [“Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]”, 2024, p. 5]


###  {#d41d8c}

“haracterization, he finds that the "conservative ideology" that underpins today's Republican Party is a mix of economic libertarianism, anti-Communist sentiment, and religiosity” [“Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]”, 2024, p. 8]


###  {#d41d8c}

“the partisanship of language tends to switch when House control switches, but in the direction of the new minority party. We formally tested the hypothesis that there was no shift in measured linguistic partisanship with changes in partisan control of the House, and were unable to reject it, but the limited power of such a test warrants c” [“Political Polarization and the Dynamics of Political Language: Evidence from 130 Years of Partisan Speech [with Comments and Discussion]”, 2024, p. 25]


###  {#d41d8c}

“The first aspect of political polarization, which we call “interactional polarization,” focuses on a process whereby participants in a debate increasingly interact with likeminded individuals, while disengaging from interactions with others who hold opposing viewpoints.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 101]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Despite the recent salience of theories regarding fragmented “echo chambers” or “filter bubbles,” it remains contentious whether social media do indeed drive such interactional polarization” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 101]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Heterophilic interactions appear to be more common along so-called “weak ties” occasional communications that are not underfed by strong social bonds such as friendship or sustained collaboration – while most “strong ties” (among friends, within teams, etc.) are predominantly homophilic” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 101]


###  {#d41d8c}

“H2 (Interactional Polarization): Interaction patterns on social media become increasingly homophilic over time.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 102]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Individuals embedded within more homophilic interaction networks subsequently express more extreme positions in their contributions.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 102]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Where social media foster political talk to focus on interactions with likeminded individuals, accordingly, discussions should predominantly express amiable sentiment. At the same time, the diminishment of cross-cutting talk should be accompanied by aggravated negative attitudes toward outgroups.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 103]


###  {#d41d8c}

“As the world’s foremost social media platform, Facebook’s popularity is arguably derived largely from its capacity to immerse its users in a feed of contents that cater to their personal interests and leanings. To do this, the platform relies heavily on users’ selfcurated networks of friends, but also on an algorithm that prioritizes content based on users’ interests and support for similar posts, displaying only a small share of predominantly congenial, supportive contents” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“primacy of private and personal interactions” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Facebook has become the prime suspect for the creation of homophilic echo chambers” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Twitter is defined primarily by its unrestricted publicness. Anyone, even non-users, can read any tweet, and any user can respond to any contribution. Users can follow others without a need for permission, enabling asymmetric, non-reciprocated ties.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“ts newsfeed personalizes the content presented to each user in response to known interests and views.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Twitter’s inbuilt character limitation (to 140 or 280 characters per message) limits the space for argumentative contestation (Nahon, 2016; Sagolla, 2009).” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 104]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Reflecting Twitter’s ambiguous profile, the existing literature yields conflicting findings regarding its tendency toward homophily and polarization (e.g., Kwak et al., 2010 detected little homophily; Weng et al., 2010; Hong &amp; Kim, 2016; Colleoni et al., 2014 found the opposite).” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 105]


###  {#d41d8c}

“social media platform in a narrow sense (following Ellison and Boyd (2013) definition)” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 105]


###  {#d41d8c}

“For the present study, we collected all posts related to the incident and subsequent debate on Twitter, on publicly open Facebook posts,3 and from two WhatsApp groups dedicated to political discussion.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 107]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Considering the effect of homophilic interactions on expressed positions, our data confirm users’ tendency to express more extreme views if interactions with likeminded users take in a larger share of their social media communications (H3).” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 111]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Accordingly, the study reveals a range of important theoretical and methodological blind spots in the existing scholarship on polarization in social media.” [Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 114]


###  {#d41d8c}

“Beyond questioning the widespread reliance on Twitter (and limited public Facebook) data to draw conclusions about social media as a whole, our study also highlights the perils of inferring dynamic properties from static data.” ([Yarchi et al., 2021, p. 114](zotero://select/library/items/G9PJESFN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PWDIUB7P?page=18&amp;annotation=2ZZLNYSE))


###  {#d41d8c}

“That social psychology has long shown this tendency to associate with like-minded others is common cross-culturally. However, there is new fear that the current media system is helping people enter echo chambers more easily than ever before.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 731](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=4&amp;annotation=D3F75I4P))

“Twitter itself is used by a relatively small proportion of the population, about one-quarter of the UK, which is younger, wealthier, and better-educated than Britain as a whole” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 732](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=5&amp;annotation=QMU37TV3))


###  {#d41d8c}

“For example, just 2% of individuals in the US rely only on social media for news (Newman et al., 2017). Furthermore, social media, search engines, and news aggregators are becoming increasingly popular as a way to access news cross-nationally, with 65% of the cross-national sample in the Reuters Digital News (2017) survey reporting a preference for accessing news brands indirectly.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 733](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=6&amp;annotation=ARQMFH5N))

“going directly to a news source such as the BBC remains more common in the UK (Newman et al., 2017).” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 733](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=6&amp;annotation=23YUR89I))


###  {#d41d8c}

“A core problem with this line of research is that most studies select only one or a few media to focus on and so the comparative utility or effects of use of media in a diverse media environment are unclear.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 733](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=6&amp;annotation=MIUQB3SJ))


###  {#d41d8c}

“First, even individuals who have strong partisan affiliation report using both general news sites (which are largely non-partisan and include a variety of issues) and niche news sites (which may be partisan or focused on specific issues) – Republicans and Democrats have media diets which are quite similar” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 734](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=7&amp;annotation=4WIRKA3Z))


###  {#d41d8c}

“While one might receive primarily left-leaning political content on Twitter, they may be incidentally exposed to a right-leaning perspective from a family member on Facebook or they might hear a debate between representatives from various perspectives on a television news broadcast.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 734](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=7&amp;annotation=T9K36QYM))


###  {#d41d8c}

“Strömbäck et al. show that news polarization in Sweden is increasing over time and that political interest is a key driver for news consumption” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 734](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=7&amp;annotation=5TMJU5CX))

###  {#d41d8c}

“First, that respondents with no political interest are in an echo chamber. We examine this possibility using the regressions in Table 3. The results in this table are based only on the respondents who said they had ‘No interest at all’ in politics, N = 243.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 739](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=12&amp;annotation=T2VM9984))


###  {#d41d8c}

“A high-choice media environment does not simply mean that individuals develop strategies to deal with the many media options available, though of course they do so as they develop their news and political information repertoires” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 740](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=13&amp;annotation=9GXR52Q8))


###  {#d41d8c}

“Our results suggest that people who are both not politically interested and who do not use diverse media are more likely to be in an echo chamber. They are less likely check multiple sources or to discover things that change their minds.” ([Dubois and Blank, 2018, p. 741](zotero://select/library/items/3738VC8D)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8TA569JX?page=14&amp;annotation=N5FBM2TS))

“We also find that polarized language is associated with greater engagement, but this association only holds for politically engaged users (both trolls and regular users). This research clarifies how trolls leverage polarized language and provides an open-source, simple tool for exploration of polarized communications on social media.” ([Simchon et al., 2022, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/AYF6C6L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI7Y3ZXS?page=1&amp;annotation=EN74UHNF))

###  {#d41d8c}

“However, not all trolls are equal. Research suggests that Russian trolls could be classified into 5 distinct types: Right, Left, News, Hashtag Gamers, and Fearmongers (56). It could be argued that a cleaner analysis would only constitute Left and Right trolls, and should be contrasted with a politically engaged American sample.” ([Simchon et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/AYF6C6L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI7Y3ZXS?page=4&amp;annotation=69NB6GY3))

###  {#d41d8c}

“Questions remain as to the extent of influence of trolls’ social media presence on real people. However, it is important to note that even a small number of agents with aggressive attitudes can have a substantial influence on the majority view, a process called “information gerrymandering”” ([Simchon et al., 2022, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/AYF6C6L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SI7Y3ZXS?page=9&amp;annotation=7FRQHN7L))
