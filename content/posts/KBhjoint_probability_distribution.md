for [random variable]({{< relref "KBhrandom_variables.md" >}})s \\(X, Y\\), the [joint probability distribution]({{< relref "KBhjoint_probability_distribution.md" >}}) is the [probability]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}) of both of them happening at once.

\begin{equation}
p(x,y)
\end{equation}

The most fundamental solution can be derived with a table where all complete [probabilities]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}) are listed. They are going to be too large to practically store.
