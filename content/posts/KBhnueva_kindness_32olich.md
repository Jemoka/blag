Oliver!

You are the talent that makes R@N work! Seriously... We'd have no work _and!_ no team if it weren't for you. Thank you for being that incredible leader to make the dream work, and also for your artful engagement in important conversations (not the least of which, GPT!) on campus through your film-making. It has been amazing being your friend and collaborator; thank you for making it all happen.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
