Teddy,

Thank you for making it all happen! Your expertise and your skill made everything go around with Scalender; it has been my privilege to learn from you and how you approach things. Thank you for being the independent leader that keeps the team together, for helping to show the best sides of everyone.

Best of luck with everything. Thank you for being a friend and a mentor for me. I am stoked to continue our collaborations well into the future.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
