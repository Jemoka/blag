Clock math.

Recall the real numbers: \\(\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\\)

That's so many numbers! Instead, let's create a _circle_ of these values. For instance, what if you only want \\(5\\):

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{Z}\_{5} = \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}
\end{equation}

This is a [group]({{< relref "KBhgroup.md" >}}) under addition.
