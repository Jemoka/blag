Logan,

Wow... Its been an amazing year working together. I don't know how you stay so cool under the almost literally _billion_ things you have going on; watching you keep it all together humbles me, and I admire this skill greatly.

Thank you for making the Studio what it is, for keeping the panic in check, and for adding levity to everyone's day. And of course, thank you for your leadership making the Studio what it is.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
