Boop.

Thank you so much for being the inspiring voice of reason(ing in Physics), for being the shoulder that I could lean on during YPT, for your unwavering intelligence charm that makes everything happen.

Also, thank you for adding bright moments of levity into my day. It really makes them better.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
