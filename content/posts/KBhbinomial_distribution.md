A [binomial distribution]({{< relref "KBhbinomial_distribution.md" >}}) is a typo of distribution whose contents are:

-   Binary
-   Independent
-   Fixed number
-   Same probability

The expected value of \\(X\\) following a [binomial distribution]({{< relref "KBhbinomial_distribution.md" >}}) is \\(np\\), and the standard deviation of \\(X\\) would be \\(\sqrt{np(1-p)}\\).
