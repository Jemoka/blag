[PMF]({{< relref "KBhprobability_mass_function.md" >}}) is a function that maps possible outcomes of a discrete [random variable]({{< relref "KBhrandom_variables.md" >}})s to the corresponding probability.

For random variable \\(Y\\), we have:

\begin{equation}
f(k) = P(Y=k)
\end{equation}

and \\(f\\) is a function that is the [PMF]({{< relref "KBhprobability_mass_function.md" >}}), which is the mapping between a [random variable]({{< relref "KBhrandom_variables.md" >}}) and a value it takes on to the probability that the [random variable]({{< relref "KBhrandom_variables.md" >}}) takes on that value.


## Shorthand {#shorthand}

\begin{equation}
P(Y=k) = p(y), where\ y=k
\end{equation}

its written smaller \\(y\\) represents a _case_ of \\(Y\\) where \\(Y=y\\).

For this to be correct, we have to
