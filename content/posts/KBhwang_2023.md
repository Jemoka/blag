## One-Liner {#one-liner}

Modeling carbon storage operations as a POMDP to show how different monitoring strategies can influence decision quality. Evalutae


## Novelty {#novelty}

Applying POMDP to the task of carbon capture monitor planning.


## Notable Methods {#notable-methods}

POMDP formulation

-   Solver: POMCPOW
-   Reward: trapped, free, and exited Co2
-   Action: injector placement
-   Observation: CO2 saturation
-   Belief: "3D porospoty?"

Experimental design validated by simulations of CO2 sperad through injectors
