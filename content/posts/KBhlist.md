A [list]({{< relref "KBhlist.md" >}}) is an ****ordered collection**** of \\(n\\) elements.


## requirements {#requirements}

-   Obviously \\(n \in \mathbb{N}\\) or \\(n=0\\), as list length cannot be negative
-   \\(n\\) is also not \\(\infty\\), list have finite length, so infinitely long ordered sets are not lists


## additional info {#additional-info}

-   two lists are equal IFF they have
    -   same \\(n\\)
    -   same elements
    -   same order
