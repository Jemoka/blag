A [PKM]({{< relref "KBhpkm.md" >}}) is a tool (like this one!) to help manage your nodes and knowledge.

-   storing AND processing; just storing is just PIM not PKM
-   PKM = PIM (personal info management) + GTD + knowledge management
-   goal: narrowing "flood" and focus on useful areas
-   move from passive =&gt; active consumption
-   create, not just reguritate


## PKM and Context {#pkm-and-context}

-   store info based on context


## Strategy {#strategy}

-   What are you trying to organize
-   what are the inputs?
    -   email? lectures?:
        -   "reference" type emails
        -   lecture notes
        -   tasks?
-   what are you trying to make?
    -   test? essays?
        -   a time blocking schedule
        -   studying for tests (i.e. [linear algebra]({{< relref "KBhlinear_algebra_index.md" >}}))
-   what does your process look like?
-   what parts of it would you like to improve?
