## Motivation {#motivation}

One envelope has 10 times the money in the other money.

WLOG let \\(x\\) be the envelope in Cary's hand. The money in \\(y\\), then, \\(y = \frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{1}{10}x)+\frac{1}{2}\qty (10x) = 0.05x+5x = 5.05x\\). Wat.

Basically; regardless if Cary took the envelope \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), the _other_ envelope is expected to have \\(5\times\\) more money.
