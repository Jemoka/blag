Proposal: based on feedback on TIC-focus on **one case study** and isolate it well


## Quotes {#quotes}

“Daniel Lerner (1958) saw mass media as the main catalyst for social change. Lerner argued that media exposed people who possess traditional values to the “modern” world, and that exposure in turn produced a desire to live in it.” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 467]

“Lerner’s arguments were expectedly later criticized. For some, they did not consider the fact that access to mass communication can be highly unequal in some countries in the global South. Work on Latin America, for example, showed that, in rural areas, media are often dominated by elites (Beltrán 1976)” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 467]

“Equipped with reliable longitudinal data newly available, this scholarship demonstrates that there exists an association between levels of economic development and the adoption of “self-expression” values, such as support for gender equality and tolerance for homosexuality.” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 468]

“Based on social contact theory, which suggests that individuals become more tolerant of groups as they interact with them, some scholars have shown that contact with “imagined” or “vicarious” communities that are diffused through mass media can have an effect on lowering prejudices and improving attitudes toward gay people (Riggle 1996; Schiappa, Gregg, and Hewes 2006).” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 468]

“As depicted in Figure 3, the predicted probabilities of supporting SSM are consistent with our expectation that those who pay attention to the news and use the Internet daily are much more likely to support SSM. We believe this is because those who both pay attention to the news and use the Internet daily are likely to encounter news online that helps diffuse global attitudes about SSM” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 475]

“Meanwhile, for those that use the Internet often, but who do not pay attention to the news, the Internet is likely to be a source of entertainment or social interaction, which are not necessarily associated with encountering new information related to SSM. This interaction between Internet use and news consumption is also evident and significant when the data are disaggregated by year (see appendix).” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 475]

“This suggests that people who never use the Internet are not any more or less likely to support SSM regardless of whether most other people are on the Internet. In contrast, for those who use the Internet” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 475]

“every day, as a larger percentage of the national population is on the Internet, the probability of supporting SSM increases quite rapidly, such that the average probability of supporting SSM is about 0.30 for those who use the Internet daily in societies where about 60 percent of the population is online compared to about 0.25 when only 10 percent of the population is online.” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 476]

“relationship between Internet use and levels of support for SSM is much stronger than the one between attention to news in general and SSM support.” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 477]

“It could be inferred that this is simply because Latin Americans that use the Internet more frequently are simply more liberal. However, we have controlled for variables that are known to be associated with the holding of liberal views, such as levels of education, age, gender, support for democracy, religiosity, and political ideology. We know that Internet use in Latin America has steadily increased over the last decade, and that Internet exposure allows people access to a broader range of viewpoints and arguments.” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 477]

“The results lend credence to the argument, derived from social contact theory, that increased exposure to gays and lesbians as well as to discussions about homosexuality and the merits of SSM may have a normalizing effect on individuals’ attitudes. Research also shows that such interaction can take place through mass media (Berggren and Nilsson 2015)” [⁨Díez⁩ and ⁨Dion⁩, 2022, p. 478]

“we find evidence of moral culture wars between ideologies and show that constituencies that express higher levels of emotion and have fewer actively engaged participants often precede legalization efforts that fail” [⁨Zhang⁩ and ⁨Counts⁩, 2015, p. 2603]

“we build statistical models to predict the outcome of potential policy changes, with our best model achieving 87% accuracy” [⁨Zhang⁩ and ⁨Counts⁩, 2015, p. 2603]

“When looking at the policy events that happened in these states, two of the three states moving from battleground to liberal legalized same-sex marriage during this time, while one (Vermont) had already legalized same-sex marriage.” [⁨Zhang⁩ and ⁨Counts⁩, 2015, p. 2607]

“We found that policies that passed had a greater percentage of people with sustained interest over time, had greater overall engagement levels, and had signiﬁcantly higher levels of language related to fairness and openness before the decision. On the other hand, states with policies that failed had higher levels of anxiety, religion, and tentativeness. These ﬁndings align with previ- ous research characterizing the same-sex marriage debate as a “culture war” [1], where proponents advocate for it in terms of fairness morality, while opponents argue against it in terms of religious morality.” [⁨Zhang⁩ and ⁨Counts⁩, 2015, p. 2610]

“We show that the expressions of a constituency as measured on Twitter was indeed predictive of same-sex marriage policy change, conﬁrming prior research [22]. We also found that both the value of our measures as well as how they changed over time were predictive of policy change, suggesting that policymakers may be attuned to both the views of their constituents as well as general trends.” [⁨Zhang⁩ and ⁨Counts⁩, 2015, p. 2610]

“Studies have shown a link between broader attitudes concerning equal rights and morality and attitudes on speciﬁc policies dealing with gay rights” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1055]

“This inquiry argues that media coverage (in terms of both speciﬁc frames and the competition between said frames) of same-sex marriage and civil unions shapes levels of opposition to these policies.” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1056]

“This model also reveals a potential relationship between morality framing and opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions.” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1069]

“In total, there appears to be a link between Americans hearing concerning religion, tradition, and worship in reporting on same-sex marriage and civil unions and being more opposed to such policies, yet the link approaches but does not quite reach traditional levels of signiﬁcance we would seek to declare a ﬁnding more deﬁnitively.” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1069]

“The relationship between equality framing and opinion on same-sex marriage and civil unions (in both the short and long run) suggests that advocates of these policies can and should be using language linked with rights, fairness, and justice if they wish to continue to diminish levels of opposition in the public and subsequently create momentum for legislative efforts.” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1073]

“Morality framing in-and-of itself did not seem to have as much power as equality framing when it came to changing minds between 2004 and 2011, but those interested in spreading a message of morality and rolling back same-sex marriage and civil unions efforts should realize that, should they tip the balance of the competition between these two frames back in their favor, levels of opposition have the potential to shift once more in a way that beneﬁts their policy goals.” [Johnson, 2012, p. 1074]

“The shift in priorities among many gays and lesbians (from tolerance to acceptance) requires a reassessment of the type of moral bracketing prescribed by political liberalism.” [Ball, p. 1877]

“The core of conservative opposition to gay rights is based on religious and moral doctrines.10 2 Bracketing these doctrines, that is, placing them outside the bounds of public reasoning, would seem to undermine conservative arguments.” [Ball, p. 1891]

“It is not clear, however, that even Rawls believes that controversial issues such as the rights and privileges to which homosexuals are entitled in a well-ordered society can be decided within the limitations that political liberalism imposes on public reasoning.” [Ball, p. 1891]

“Confronted with their opponents' arguments about the immorality of homosexuality, proponents of same-sex marriage have two choices: to abide by the liberal limitations on public reasoning through a bracketing of morals and values, or to move beyond those limitations and respond to moral objections with moral arguments of their own” [Ball, p. 1894]

“But a state's unwillingness to recognize same-sex marriage, even if based on notions of morality, differs qualitatively from a state's use of majoritar- ian morality to criminalize homosexual sodomy; the latter, and not the former, involves state coercion to deprive individuals of their libert” [Ball, p. 1899]

“Experience has shown that it is not possible to debate the recognition of same-sex marriage without opponents making a normative connection between homosexuality and other forms of human relationships such as polygamy.” [Ball, p. 1900]

“Despite Finnis's belief that homosexual conduct is always wrong and immoral, he recognizes arguments in favor of what he calls the "standard Euro- pean modem position" that is unwilling to punish immoral acts committed in 215 private” [Ball, p. 1911]

“Individuals can be harmed if there is an insufficient range of choices that make attainment of an autonomous life possible. This harm, then, justifies governmental action that seeks to provide individuals with an adequate range of choices.” [Ball, p. 1929]

“The compromise position between the traditional liberal paradigm that rejects all notions of normative value as constituting a legitimate part of a public discourse relating to the scope and applicability of rights and the constricted new natural law position that views only one type of sexual act as being moral, is, in fact, embodied in our society's regulation of heterosexual intimacy. While marriage is exalted as a valuable social institution in a normative sense, heterosexual intimate acts that occur outside of marriage, such as adultery and fornication, are usually tolerated by society.” [Ball, p. 1941]

“it is impossible to engage in a fruitful discussion of same-sex marriage without engaging the normative ques- tions; it is impossible to grapple with the complexities of the issue by simply asking for equality and state-neutrality and for protection against discrimina- tion. At least in the particular context of same-sex marriage, and perhaps in other controversial social issues as well, the bracketing of moral concerns and judgments is unrealistic, and for gays and lesbians, ultimately harmful and self-defeating.” [Ball, p. 1942]
