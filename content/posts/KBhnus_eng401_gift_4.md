Traditional values in Caribbean and African societies often place womens’ value in the context of other men. When women pursue independent careers such as midwives and healers, they could be called “witches.”

Maryse Condé demonstrates this bias in the novel _I, Tituba_. She writes that “Yao’s love had transformed [Tituba]’s mother”, making her a “young woman.” (Condé 7) In the passage, the womanhood of Tituba’s mother is framed as only being granted when she encounters Yao; in contrast, Mama Yaya’s womanhood exists independently, yet she is viewed as a witch.
