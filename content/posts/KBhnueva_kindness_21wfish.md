Hi William,

Thank you very much for being the constant voice of sanity and reason, the leader keeping me in emotional and physical check during YPT, and for your dedication to your craft in physics and beyond.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss ML, for humoring my numerous rants and terrible jokes, for listening to my mediocre music. It has been a privilege being your partner during YPT.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
