Thomas,

It has been a privilege working with you during YPT. Your intelligence, depth of knowledge (especially about _everything_ in our darn physical world), and your coolness under immense pressure has continually inspired me during and after the competition.

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss ML together, and for putting up with me over the last year. It has been incredible.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
