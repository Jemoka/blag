## Metric {#metric}

Sometimes we can just get a specification easily from just a metric, like ("the aircraft can't be more than 50 meters apart")


### value at risk {#value-at-risk}

see [value at risk]({{< relref "KBhvalue_at_risk.md#value-at-risk" >}})


## composite metrics {#composite-metrics}

-   **weighted sum method**: depends on how you care about each value, perform weighted sum and optimez over a single metric
-   **goal distance metric**: pick a [Utopia Point]({{< relref "KBhsu_cs361_apr302024.md#utopia-point" >}}), and find distances from that point
