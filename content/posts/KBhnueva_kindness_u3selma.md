Selina,

Thank you very much for making [funing tork]({{< relref "KBhtuning_forks.md" >}})s happen, and for your calm leadership, being often our voice of reason even throughout the craziness the project involves. Thank you for your willingness to engage in deep conversations, and for humoring me and my weirdness throughout the last many years.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
