Want mechanics? No. You get energy.

First, recall the [stationary-action principle]({{< relref "KBhstationary_action_principle.md" >}}). To define a system in [Lagrangian Mechanics]({{< relref "KBhlagrangian_mechanics.md" >}}), we define a [smooth function]({{< relref "KBhsmooth_function.md" >}}) \\(L\\), called the "Lagrangian", and some configuration space (axis) \\(M\\).

By convention, \\(L=T-V\\). \\(T\\) is the kinetic energy in the system, and \\(V\\) is the potential energy in the system.

By the [stationary-action principle]({{< relref "KBhstationary_action_principle.md" >}}), then, we require \\(L\\) to remain at a critical point (max, min, saddle.) This fact allows us to calculate the equations of motion by hold \\(L\\) at such a point, and evolving the \\((T,V)\\) pair to remain at that point.

The notion of solving for optimal \\((T,V)\\), which will give us the equations of motion, is why Lagrangian multipliers were invented.
