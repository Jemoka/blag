Hello Kian,
Wow. R@N, PERCH, XRT, UCSF... What _can't_ you do? I am humbled by your work and your dedication---especially your drive to chase what you want out of your high school experience. Thank you for seeing me through the tough time for my family together with me, and for continuing to champion your own work and to even support others at Nueva through your gracious leadership. For the last two years, it has been my unbelievable privilege and luck to call you my friend and collaborator.

Sincerely yours,
Houjun "Jack" Liu
