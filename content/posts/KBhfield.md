A [field]({{< relref "KBhfield.md" >}}) is a special set.


## constituents {#constituents}

-   distinct elements of at least \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)
-   operations of addition and multiplication


## requirements {#requirements}

-   [closed]({{< relref "KBhclosed.md" >}})
-   [commutativity]({{< relref "KBhcommutivity.md" >}})
-   [associativity]({{< relref "KBhassociative.md" >}})
-   [identities]({{< relref "KBhidentity.md" >}}) (both additive and multiplicative)
-   [inverse]({{< relref "KBhinverses.md" >}})s (both additive and multiplicative)
-   distribution

Therefore, \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is a [field]({{< relref "KBhfield.md" >}}), and so is \\(\mathbb{C}\\) (which we proved in [properties of complex arithmetic]({{< relref "KBhcomplex_number.md#requirements" >}})).
