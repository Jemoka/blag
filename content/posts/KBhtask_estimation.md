Step 0: know what you are building.


## breaking tasks {#breaking-tasks}

The process of [breaking tasks](#breaking-tasks) down.

-   We need to research tasks to see how complex they are + how to break them down
-   Research takes time! It should be its own task
-   Over the process of research, the task becomes much simpler


## estimating tasks {#estimating-tasks}

Requirement: tasks should _always_ be estimated by the person doing the work.

-   [Task Estimation]({{< relref "KBhtask_estimation.md" >}}) should be done _each time!_ tasks shift
-   Estimate only in powers of 2: 30 minutes, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, etc.
-   If you never done something before, **double** the time than you estimate
-   If you are teaching someone to do something, **quadruple** the time than you estimate
