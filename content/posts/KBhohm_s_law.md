\begin{equation}
V = IR
\end{equation}

where, \\(V\\) is the voltage across the resister, \\(I\\) the [current]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md" >}}), and \\(R\\) the resistance.


## power (physics) {#power--physics}

the speed at which electrical energy dissipates into heat is called [power](#power--physics):

\begin{equation}
P = IV
\end{equation}

where, \\(P\\) is power, and \\(I\\) the [current]({{< relref "KBhcurrent.md" >}}), and \\(V\\) the [voltage]({{< relref "KBhvoltage.md" >}}).
