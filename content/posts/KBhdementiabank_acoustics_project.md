The [DementiaBank Acoustics Project]({{< relref "KBhdementiabank_acoustics_project.md" >}}) is a working title for an acoustic-only challenge for AD detection. This document serves as the lab notebook for this project.


## Background Reading {#background-reading}

I first began by doing a literature survey on the [ADReSS Challenge]({{< relref "KBhadress_literature_survey.md" >}}) results published in the Frontiers AD special interest group issue.


## Proposal {#proposal}

[DementiaBank Acoustics Project Proposal]({{< relref "KBhdementiabank_acoustics_project_proposal.md" >}})


## Ideas {#ideas}

Can we correlate any longitudinal data with [NACC]({{< relref "KBhnacc.md" >}})?


## Data {#data}

-   dementia/English/Lanzi: Alyssa Lanzi's new data
-   dementia/English/Delaware

-   What are the standard for acoustic features?
-   Motor cortex/frontal control may also be impacted
-   Vocal tremer

-   What are the predictors? How automatic can we make it?
