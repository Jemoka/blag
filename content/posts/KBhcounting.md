[counting]({{< relref "KBhcounting.md" >}}) asks: "how many possible outcomes satisfy an event?"

(like, 3 times will we roll even in a regular fair dice)


## step rule of counting {#step-rule-of-counting}

If an outcome can be from \\(A\\) **or** \\(B\\), where \\(A \cap B = \emptyset\\), then, the total number of outcomes are \\(|A| + |B| = m+n\\)
