## Films complicate Iago by introducing independent axes for love and respect {#films-complicate-iago-by-introducing-independent-axes-for-love-and-respect}

The four texts' Iagos can be treated in the same framework of "love"--hatred, whether racial or otherwise, for Othello---versus "respect"---deference to the authority of Othello.

-   Shakesphere's Othello: No Love, Has Respect
    -   No Love: Iago pretty much said as much "I hate the Moor"
    -   Understand the role of power Othello has: "In following him, I follow but myself"; evidently want to be Lieutenant for his power
-   Sax's Othello: No Love, No Respect
    -   No Love: overtly racist "You stupid, patronizing ape ... how very quaint, how very d--- sunday school" --- for all the talk about love, it is "If I could find any whose brains were as big as their dicks, Iâ€™d be a happy man, eh?" kind of love: oversexualization
    -   No Respect: he is basically Iago's understudy "how very good for you to acknowledge what you owe to me, you owe me everything, everything!"
-   Deardon's Othello: Yes Love, No Respect
    -   Yes Love: the two were ostensibly and naturally friends---during the subtext perhaps more of a reflection for civil rights sentiment (especially via the counter-culture language of Jazz of the time) "apparently natural construct of a racially diverse ... sub-culture: 'the [diverse racial archetypes] intermingle smoothly and fraternisation creates deep emotional pangs, rather than embarrassment'" (Kinematograph Weekly) (Burton and O'Sullivan)
    -   No Respect: the flip side is that the direct response is to remove Desdemona from Othello


## Comparing Iago {#comparing-iago}

-   No Love, No respect | Direct objective: to get Othello's position at **the Met**
-   Yes Love, No Respect | Direct objective: to remove Desdemona from Othello's control and start a **band**
-   No Love, Yes Respect | Direct objective: faithful---to get Othello to choose him as the direct regional militia leader &lt;&gt; Shakesphere

Missing: Yes Love, Yes Respect


## Actual Othello {#actual-othello}

-   IAGO: "No more of drowning, do you hear?" &lt;&gt; Omkara


## Bhardwaj's Iago {#bhardwaj-s-iago}

-   Direct objective: faithful---to get Othello to choose him as the direct regional militia leader
-   Hidden objective: ...??? not sure not well motivated
-   Direct Downfall of Othello: "ocular proof" of jingly heirloom
-   Main Methods
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere beer to Cassio
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere making Othello overhear conversation with Cassio about Bianca to think its about Desdemona
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere convinces Desdemona to soothsay for Cassio
    -   Random bad omen about bird/snake?
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere Heirloom
-   Distinctions
    -   Process of manipulation is more toxically masculine instead of weird submissiveness
    -   "I hate Moor" + drowning scene took place somewhat after being provoked by Rodrigo firing his jealousy after Iago fired Rodrigo's jealousy about Desdemona
-   Unique shots/catchphrases/features
    -   Instances of violence/impending violence underscored by very cheerful music
        -   Cheerful music as Othello beats up everybody in the rival gang
        -   Happy cheerful party music as Cassio becomes drunk and gets demoted


## Sax's Iago {#sax-s-iago}

-   Direct objective: to get Othello's position at **the Met**
-   Hidden objective: [racism for]/[sexual desire for] Othello
-   Direct Downfall of Othello: A, B, and C for intimacy test for the **robe**
-   Main methods
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion
    -   Hinted to Cassio that marriage is not genuine and provoked him
    -   Screwed up Othello's investigation of the constable
    -   _Demanded intimacy test and A, B, AND C_
-   Distinctions
    -   Wants Othello's position, and probably his love
    -   Is more explicitly lying (A, B, AND C)
    -   Is more overtly racist: beginning conversation with Sinclair, the racist ("I hate the moor" proxy) rant
    -   Relationship with Emilia seem less strained
-   Unique shots/catchphrases/features
    -   Staring up into the sky w/ shaft of light
    -   "I know what you are talking about, I've been there" prior to manipulation
    -   "And that's a promise"


## Darden's Iago {#darden-s-iago}

-   Direct objective: to remove Desdemona from Othello's control and start a **band**
-   Hidden objective: to date Desdemona
-   Direct Downfall of Othello: [the **cigarette box**?] + edited tape recording
-   Main Methods
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere gave weed to Cassio to cause him to make a scene
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion re: knowledge from Emilia
    -   Engineered Desdemona's song to be specifically pointed
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere "ocular proof": cigarette case; also insinuating that Cassio's weed came from Desdemona
    -   Doctoring the tape to highlight Cassio's supposed infidelity
-   Distinctions
    -   In love with Desdemona and had separate business motivations distinct from taking Othello/Cassio's
    -   Didn't seem particularly racist, was previously friends with Othello?
    -   Is more explicitly lying by doctoring tape, but words closer to Shakesphere's Iago
    -   Didn't succeed
    -   Most strained relationship with Emilia, "I love nobody. Don't even love Jonny"
-   Unique shots/catchphrases/features
    -   Shot of Cousin Jonny / Rodrigo alone, in his home, isolated with light cast on him
    -   Frenzied drum solo
    -   Motivated somewhat by Lou, the financier
    -   The rising of stairs up and down the main factory as well as to a side building
    -   Weed.
-   Close reading Iago's first drum solo <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA-vKHOVDCw>
    -   Iago: looks to the side, then at the camera directly
    -   Othello: looks generally at the direction of the camera, but as camera pans in closes his eyes and look down and away
    -   Desdemona: looks entirely to the side, uncaring
    -   Iago: looks down (like Othello's ending shot), then looks up and to the side, cutting to...
    -   Othello: looking at the opposite side, seemingly "towards" Iago, then looks down
    -   Iago: as drum solo becomes more frenzied, (mildly extreme) close up staring dead into the camera
    -   _frienzied drum soloing_
    -   Iago: looks down, and then to the side, seemingly contemplating
    -   Desdemona: stares dead ahead
    -   Othello: looks to the side and down, hand holding head
    -   Iago: eyes pans across audience
