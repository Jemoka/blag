## Sax's Iago {#sax-s-iago}

-   Direct objective: to get Othello's position at **the Met**
-   Hidden objective: [racism for]/[sexual desire for] Othello
-   Direct Downfall of Othello: A, B, and C for intimacy test for the **robe**
-   Main methods
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion
    -   Hinted to Cassio that marriage is not genuine
    -   _Demanded intimacy test and A, B, AND C_
-   Distinctions
    -   Wants Othello's position, and probably his love
    -   Is more explicitly lying (A, B, AND C)
    -   Is more overtly racist: beginning conversation with Sinclair, the racist ("I hate the moor" proxy) rant
    -   Relationship with Emilia seem less strained
-   Unique shots/catchphrases/features
    -   Staring up into the sky w/ shaft of light
    -   "I know what you are talking about, I've been there" prior to manipulation
    -   "And that's a promise"


## Darden's Iago {#darden-s-iago}

-   Direct objective: to remove Desdemona from Othello's control and start a **band**
-   Hidden objective: to date Desdemona
-   Direct Downfall of Othello: [the **cigarette box**?] + edited tape recording
-   Main Methods
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere gave weed to Cassio to cause him to make a scene
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere conversation to arise suspicion re: knowledge from Emilia
    -   Engineered Desdemona's song to be specifically pointed
    -   &lt;&gt; Shakesphere "ocular proof": cigarette case; also insinuating that Cassio's weed came from Desdemona
    -   Doctoring the tape to highlight Cassio's supposed infidelity
-   Distinctions
    -   In love with Desdemona and had separate business motivations
    -   Didn't seem particularly racist, was previously friends with Othello?
    -   Is more explicitly lying by doctoring tape, but words closer to Shakesphere's Iago
    -   Didn't succeed
    -   Most strained relationship with Emilia, "I love nobody. Don't even love Jonny"
-   Unique shots/catchphrases/features
    -   Shot of Cousin Jonny / Rodrigo alone, in his home, isolated with light cast on him
    -   Frenzied drum solo
    -   Motivated somewhat by Lou, the financier
    -   The rising of stairs up and down the main factory as well as to a side building
    -   Weed.
