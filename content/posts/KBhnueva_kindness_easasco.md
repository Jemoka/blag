Sasha!

Wow. It has been a year!! Thank you very much for sticking together with [funing tork]({{< relref "../../KBhtuning_forks.md" >}})s since the beginning, and for seeing this incredibly project through together. It has been an honour being your collaborator.

I am super excited to dive head-first into QuantumNLP. I can't wait to see what we create next together. Thank you for everything.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
