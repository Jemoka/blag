a [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}}) of [probability distribution]({{< relref "KBhprobability_distributions.md" >}}) govern the [probabilities]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}) associated with different conditions in that distribution.

importantly, for a [discrete distribution]({{< relref "KBhprobability_distributions.md#discrete-distribution" >}}) system with 6 parameters, we only need 5 [independent]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md#independence" >}}) [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s to be able to satisfy the entire system. This is because a probability distribution must sum to 1.
