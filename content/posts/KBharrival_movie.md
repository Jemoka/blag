-   "memory is a strange thing"
    -   "we are so bound by time, by its order"---progression of time backed into the inherentness of language
-   the story opens with an emotional connection to the audience for imprinting


## Lecture Scene---Alien Invasion {#lecture-scene-alien-invasion}

-   "**Authority** assess the object" emphasis a weird place
-   Shadow framing of the events
-   question: why is _she_ so worried

## Approach Scene {#approach-scene}

-   Music pitched the "alien" flutters tonally
    -   Kind of emotional communication with the audience, the Dalian sound + high highs EQs is a [foreignization]({{< relref "KBhtranslation_theory.md#spectrum-of-translation" >}}) technique
    -   _taller_ than it was in the movie


## Entry Scene {#entry-scene}

-   Driving: perspective questions
-   "every 18 hours"
-   continuous panning from black **downwards**
-   Sargent's differing eye length
-   Difference in gravity and perspectives?
-   Camera angle trickery, panning **down** is no longer the same direction
-   "light at the end of the tunnel"
-   again, music + dissonant sounds create [foreignization]({{< relref "KBhtranslation_theory.md#spectrum-of-translation" >}}) in the audience

## Panic worried Scene {#panic-worried-scene}

-   Fear of the unknown

    -   "unline speech, a logogram is free of time"
