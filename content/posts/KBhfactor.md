in [probability]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}), a [factor]({{< relref "KBhfactor.md" >}}) \\(\phi\\) is a value you can assign to each distinct value in a [discrete distribution]({{< relref "KBhprobability_distributions.md#discrete-distribution" >}}) which acts as the [probability]({{< relref "KBhprobability.md" >}}) of that value occurring. They are considered [parameter]({{< relref "KBhparameter.md" >}})s of the [discrete distribution]({{< relref "KBhprobability_distributions.md#discrete-distribution" >}}).
