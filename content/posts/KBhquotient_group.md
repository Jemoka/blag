a [quotient group]({{< relref "KBhquotient_group.md" >}}) is a [subgroup]({{< relref "KBhsubgroup.md" >}}) where you mask out multiples:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{Z}} / 3 \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}

this is essentially the same thing as \\(\mod 3\\).

However, each value in this new group is a [group]({{< relref "KBhgroup.md" >}}) itself, a set of numbers; for instance, in \\(\mathbb{Z} / 3\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(0\\) is actually the group \\(\\{\dots -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \dots\\}\\).
