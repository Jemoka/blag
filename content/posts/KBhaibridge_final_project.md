One of the things that makes a very good Sommelier is their ability to figure out as much details about a wine as possible with very little information.

You are tasked with making a Sommelier program that is able to figure both the type and quality of wine from available chemical information.

A good Sommelier uses as little information as possible to deduce the quality and type. So, what is the best model(s) you can build for predicting quality and type of wine based on the least amount of features? What features should you choose?

Also, you have a "flavor-ater" machine that makes a linear combination of multiple chemical features together (similar to PCA), which is counted as one chemical feature after combination.

Good luck!
