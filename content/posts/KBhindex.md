## Who's this guy? {#who-s-this-guy}

I am a [human](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28765741?v=4) interested in [linguistic analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10661), [L2 learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-language_acquisition), and [user interfaces](https://www.shabang.cf/). [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) &amp; [Emacs](https://github.com/Jemoka/.emacs.d) are cool. I run [Condution](https://www.condution.com/), [Shabang](https://www.shabang.cf/), and [MODAP](https://www.modap.io), do [research in NLP and education pedagogy](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2156-5903), direct Science Friday [streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB5KLodjBbZ40P-1R3LjMSxRbhwpS7tWu), captain an [entrepreneurship studio](https://youtu.be/CIjqZno8Noc), and recently began working for [Brian MacWhinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacWhinney) on projects in linguistics.

Need to catch me? [hliu@shabang.cf](mailto:hliu@shabang.cf). Please do email me, I actually check.


## Recent Projects {#recent-projects}

Take a look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Jemoka/) for programming projects. For larger scale things, take a look at the [Projects Index]({{< relref "KBhprojects.md" >}}) on this site.


## Notes {#notes}

This site also contains the vast majority of my course notes. It is a organized in a [zettlekasten]({{< relref "KBhzettlekasten.md" >}}) format. To begin exploring, why don't you check out [Nueva Courses Index]({{< relref "KBhnueva_courses_index.md" >}}). Accompanying this index is the collection of assignments [found here](https://taproot3.jklsnt.com/) which a few friends has collected together.


## jklsnt {#jklsnt}

Some friends and I started a small collection of fun internets that we made. [Check it out!](https://www.jklsnt.com/).


## How do I know you are you? {#how-do-i-know-you-are-you}

Good question! `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 1807A0C6` and verify with my work email. Note that GPG don't actually check fingerprints you received so do that yourself.


## Bugga Bugga Bontehu? {#bugga-bugga-bontehu}

Sometimes I use this domain as a downlink to fastcalculator to friends and coworkers. To achieve this, here are two links you could click on that I don't always promise do anything: [oliver](https://oliver.jemoka.com/) and [socks](https://socks.jemoka.com/).
