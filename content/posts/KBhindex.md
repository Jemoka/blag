## Master Indexes {#master-indexes}

The KB is a [zettlekasten]({{< relref "KBhzettlekasten.md" >}}), a connected series of notes that are atomic and links ideas together. This means that there are no "start" page.

However, in the spirit of [zettlekasten]({{< relref "KBhzettlekasten.md" >}})s, there are indexes which select for main notes and link large atomic ideas together. Therefore, you maybe interested in the following indexes.

-   [Nueva Courses Index]({{< relref "KBhnueva_courses_index.md" >}})
-   [Projects Index]({{< relref "KBhprojects.md" >}})

Tapping on either of these links would probably lead you somewhere interesting.


## Technology and Notes {#technology-and-notes}

The text of the page is set in `IBM Plex Sans`, or, when the font is unavailable, in `Helvetica`. Automatically compiled PDFs are set in `Helvetica Neue`, built via `xelatex`. The website is generated via `Hugo` with a custom-designed theme licensed under `GPL-3.0`. The content of the notes are licensed under `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0`. The compilation source is `Emacs 28`, and notes are written with `Org Roam`. Autocompletion between modes inside the framework is provided by `Company Mode`.


## Why this? {#why-this}

You maybe interested in [Starting With Why: The Knowledgebase]({{< relref "KBhstarting_with_why_the_knowledgebase.md" >}}) as a short article on why this project was started.
