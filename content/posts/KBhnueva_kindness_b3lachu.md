Lachlan,

Thank you! Its been an amazing few years collaborating together in the STEM classes which we seem to keep crossing paths in. Its been quite the privileged learning from how you think, how you approach challenges, and for your deep nuanced take on things.

Best of luck with the novel. I'm super excited to read it.

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
