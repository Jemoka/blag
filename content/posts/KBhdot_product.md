## orthogonality test {#orthogonality-test}

The [dot product]({{< relref "KBhdot_product.md" >}}) is an [orthogonality test](#orthogonality-test). If the [dot product]({{< relref "KBhdot_product.md" >}}) between the two vectors is \\(0\\), they are definitely orthogonal.


## geometric interpretation of the [dot product]({{< relref "KBhdot_product.md" >}}) {#geometric-interpretation-of-the-dot-product--kbhdot-product-dot-md}

Well, we have some shape between two vectors; then, we can first write out the [law of cosines]({{< relref "KBhlaw_of_cosines.md" >}}). Then, we can see that, for two vectors from the same origin, we can say that the projection of vector \\(\vec{A}\\) onto \\(\vec{B}\\) is written as:

\begin{equation}
|\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos \theta
\end{equation}

where, \\(\theta\\) is the angle between the two vectors.
