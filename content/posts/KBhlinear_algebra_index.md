The bible stays the same: (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Axler 1997</a>)

We will be less exploratory, Axler will pretty much tell us. However, we should try to say stuff in the class every single class period.

There is a ban on [number]({{< relref "KBhnumber.md" >}})s over 4 on this class.


## Best Practices {#best-practices}

-   Ask questions
-   Talk to each other
-   Make mistakes


## Non-Axler but Important {#non-axler-but-important}

Things we explicitly are told to know, but is not immediately in Axler. You bet you determinants are going to be here.
