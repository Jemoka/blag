Flint!

Its been what... 6 years? Thank you for your friendship through the last many many years, and for adding levity to any room you inhabit. Thank you for the intelligence and willingness you have through our many conversations: going as far back as M. D's 8th grade geometry!

Thank you for making R@N what it is, and for making the past years amazing!

Sincerely yours,

Houjun "Jack" Liu
