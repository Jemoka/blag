Hi! I'm Houjun, an undergrad at Stanford. My friends call me Jack, and you can too!

If you are looking for a formal homepage, you may find my [website](https://www.jemoka.com/) or [academic site](https://ai.stanford.edu/~houjun) more useful to you in that pursuit. Instead, I will instead keep this page updated with some [stuff]({{< relref "KBhstuff.md" >}}) (hence the title) that are evergreen resources that people ask for or what I've been up to or thinking about or will give you more context about what I'm up to.
