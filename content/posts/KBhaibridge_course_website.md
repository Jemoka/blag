Welcome to the AIBridge Course homepage.

The purpose of AIBridge is to bridge the gap between computer science and other disciplines. To many, working with AI might seem like an unreachable objective. However, in reality, one week is enough to get started. AIBridge will provide basic programming capability in Python and knowledge of object-oriented programming as well as the concepts behind machine learning and how to implement it using a popular toolbox, Scikit-Learn. Students work to complete a personally-defined project using techniques in AI, with data from their own research or with problems supplied by the Course. This one week course will be hosted in-person at UC Davis and will target mainly undergraduate and non-technical graduate students.
