Welcome to the AIBridge Course homepage.

The purpose of AIBridge is to bridge the gap between computer science and other disciplines. To many, working with AI might seem like an unreachable objective. However, in reality, one week is enough to get started. AIBridge will provide basic programming capability in Python and knowledge of object-oriented programming as well as the concepts behind machine learning and how to implement it using a popular toolbox, Scikit-Learn. Students work to complete a personally-defined project using techniques in AI, with data from their own research or with problems supplied by the Course. This one week course will be hosted in-person at UC Davis and will target mainly undergraduate and non-technical graduate students.

The course is taught by Prof. Xin Liu in collaboration with Houjun "Jack" Liu, Samuel Ren, and Albara Ah Ramli.

## Day 2: OOP + Linear Models {#day-2-oop-plus-linear-models}

Today, we are going to cover the basic intuition and terminology behind Object Oriented Programming, as well as introduce two simple, linear approaches to Machine Learning tasks: linear regression and logistic regression.

## More to come... {#more-to-come-dot-dot-dot}

We will be updating the course website over the span of this week to include more everyday before instruction starts. Based on the skills and pace of the class we may adjust our pacing, add, or change content.

-   Day 3: Data Manipulation + Classification
-   Day 4: Classification cont'd + Clustering
-   Day 5: Validation/Ops and Best Practices
