## On Paradox {#on-paradox}

**Generally: everything has multiple sides and try to recognize it**

-   chapter on paradox
-   dispelling the common notion of standards
-   _humbleness_: to recognize something, you have to know what the absence of it is
    -   equilibrium---
    -   nothing is one-sided, so stuff has multiple sides
-   possible notions of extremism: "the recognition of beauty is an ugly act"
-   highlighting this as a truth of the world---not trying to make a plan of action, but instead trying to just outline a particular view of the world
    -   **even for the way**: there is a similar side
