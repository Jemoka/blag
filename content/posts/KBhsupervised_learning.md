Supervised learning (also known as [behavioral cloning]({{< relref "KBhsupervised_learning.md" >}})) if the agent is learning what to do in an [observe-act cycle]({{< relref "KBhobserve_act_cycle.md" >}})) is a type of [decision making]({{< relref "KBhdecision_making.md" >}}) method.

1.  provide the [agent]({{< relref "KBhagent.md" >}}) with some examples
2.  use an automated learning algorithm to generalize from the example

This is good for typically representative situations, but if you are throwing an [agent]({{< relref "KBhagent.md" >}}) into a completely unfamiliar situation, supervised learning cannot perform better.
