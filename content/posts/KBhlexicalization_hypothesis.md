The [Lexicalization Hypothesis]({{< relref "KBhlexicalization_hypothesis.md" >}}) is a hypothesis proposed by [Chomsky]({{< relref "KBhchomsky.md" >}}) that states that syntactic transformations can only apply on [syntatic constituents]({{< relref "KBhsyntatic_constituents.md" >}}); therefore, the rules of putting words together is _different_ from the rules that puts phrases together.
