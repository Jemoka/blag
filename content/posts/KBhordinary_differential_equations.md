[ODE]({{< relref "KBhordinary_differential_equations.md" >}})s are [Differential Equations]({{< relref "KBhdiffeq_intro.md" >}}) in one independent variable: \\(y(x)\\).


## Overarching Categories {#overarching-categories}


### order of equations {#order-of-equations}

the [order](#order-of-equations) of an equation is the highest derivative of an equation


### linear vs. non-linear equations {#linear-vs-dot-non-linear-equations}

a solution of a differential equation is **linear** when solutions are under linear operations


### homogeneous vs. inhomogeneous equations {#homogeneous-vs-dot-inhomogeneous-equations}

whether or not, isolating all the DEPENDENT variables to the left side, is the right side zero?


### linear systems {#linear-systems}

systems of ODEs are groups of ODEs. Linear systems can obtain you a vector-value function:

\begin{equation}
y'(x) = \mqty(3 & -2 \\\ -1 & 5) \vec{y}
\end{equation}
