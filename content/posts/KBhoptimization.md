[optimization]({{< relref "KBhoptimization.md" >}}) is a [decision making method]({{< relref "KBhdecision_making.md#id-9075c44f-4b26-4f5a-9236-bc7a5c10f4ee-decision-making-method" >}}):

1.  identify a performance measure and a space of possible strategies to try
2.  try strategies with the goal of maximizing the measure

Importantly, you don't need to have a good model of the actual dynamics of the problem to be able to run the search: one only has to figure out a good performance metric to optimize with or without a good model.
