We are super excited to work through tasks in linear regression and logistic regression, as well as familiarize you with the Iris dataset.\nIris Dataset Let\u0026rsquo;s load the Iris dataset! Begin by importing the load_iris tool from sklearn. This is an easy loader scheme for the iris dataset.\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris Then, we simply execute the following to load the data.\nx,y = load_iris(return_X_y=True) We use the return_X_y argument here so that, instead of dumping a large CSV, we get the neat-cleaned input and output values.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s inspect this data a little.\nx[0] 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 We can see that each sample of the data is a vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\). They correspond to four attributes:\nseptal length septal width pedal length pedal width What\u0026rsquo;s the output?\ny[0] 0 We can actually see all the possible values of the output by putting it into a set.\nset(y) 0 1 2 There are three different classes of outputs.\nIris Setosa Iris Versicolour Iris Virginica Excellent. So we can see that we have a dataset of four possible inputs and one possible output. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do with it.\nLogistic Regression The simplest thing we can do is a logistic regression. We have a there categories for output and a lot of data for input. Let\u0026rsquo;s figure out if we can predict the output from the input!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s import logistic regression tool first, and instantiate it.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression reg = LogisticRegression() We will \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; the data to the model: adjusting the model to best represent the data. Our data has 150 samples, so let\u0026rsquo;s fit the data on 140 of them.\ntesting_samples_x = x[-5:] testing_samples_y = y[-5:] x = x[:-5] y = y[:-5] Wonderful. Let\u0026rsquo;s fit the data onto the model.\nreg = reg.fit(x,y) Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and run the model on our 10 testing samples!\npredicted_y = reg.predict(testing_samples_x) predicted_y 2 2 2 2 2 And, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out what our actual results say:\ntesting_samples_y 2 2 2 2 2 Woah! That\u0026rsquo;s excellent.\nLinear Regression Instead of predicting the output classes, we can predict some values from the output. How about if we used septal length, width, and pedal length to predict petal width? The output now is a number, not some classes, which calls for linear regression!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s import linear regression tool first, and instantiate it.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression reg = LinearRegression() We will \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo; the data to the model again. As we have cleaned out the testing_samples, we simply need to split out the fourth column for the new x and y:\nnew_x = x[:,:3] new_y = x[:,3] new_testing_samples_y = testing_samples_x[:,3] new_testing_samples_x = testing_samples_x[:,:3] Taking now our newly parsed data, let\u0026rsquo;s fit it to a linear model.\nreg = reg.fit(new_x,new_y) Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and run the model on our 10 testing samples!\nnew_predicted_y = reg.predict(new_testing_samples_x) new_predicted_y 1.7500734 1.61927061 1.79218767 2.04824364 1.86638164 And, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out what our actual results say:\nnew_testing_samples_y 2.3 1.9 2 2.3 1.8 Close on some samples, not quite there on others. How good does our model actually do? We can use .score() to figure out the \\(r^2\\) value of our line on some data.\nreg.score(new_x, new_y) 0.9405617534915884 Evidently, it seems like about \\(94\\%\\) of the variation in our output data can be explained by the input features.

In equating physical beauty with virtue, she stripped her mind, bound it, and collected self-contempt by the heap. Pauline (Polly) cont\u0026rsquo;d: She was never able, after her education in the movies, to look at a face and not assign it some category in the scale of absolute beauty, and the scale was one she absorbed in full from the silver screen. Pauline (Polly): More and more she neglected her house, her children, her man\u0026mdash;\u0026hellip;the dark edges that made the daily life with the Fishers lighter, more delicate, more lovely \u0026hellip; Here she found beauty, order, cleanliness, and praise. Pauline (Polly): Pauline kept this order, this beauty, for herself, a private world, and never introduced it into her storefront, or to her children. Cholly after Aunt Death: The funeral banquet was a peal of joy after the thunderous beauty of the funeral. It was like a street tragedy with spontaneity tucked softly into the corners of a highly formal structure. Soaphead Church: He thought it was at once the most fantastic and the most logical petition he had ever received. Here was an ugly little girl asking for beauty.

Schlesinger\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal, William E. Leuchtenburg\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal, Anthony Badger\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal.\nThrough the analysis of the New Deal programs, what was particularly salient was Anthony Badger\u0026rsquo;s framing of the event as not one that is ultimately \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; but instead one which focuses on its long-term effects in context with the future policies. The equivocal labeling allows nuance that places the Deal properly in its historical content. According to Badger, helping the poor, a significant policy goal of the deals, were left as \u0026ldquo;unfinished business\u0026rdquo; when going to war. This idea contrasts with William E. Leuchtenburg\u0026rsquo;s framing of the same event\u0026mdash;that it was never the true intention of the deal to assist in subsidies on a humane level, but that which supported the economy and incidentally those that reaped benefits on it.\nThis new frame is much more useful when analyzing the deal. In fact, Leuchtenburg took this a step further and claimed that the New Deal didn\u0026rsquo;t work largely because it was impossible for it to have repaired the damage by the Hoover administration. Furthermore, according to Schlesinger, programs like the NRA were created with already the clear assumption that there were not enough policy tools in place to actually achieve it to the fullest extent. Under this mind frame, then, it is not difficult to see the New Deal as one that intentionally brought a failing US economy\u0026mdash;and those participating in it\u0026mdash;to full swing whilst ignoring those that didn\u0026rsquo;t have an economic influence. It was, therefore, never about helping \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo;: it is a policy and economic tool like any other.\nThrough this somewhat revisionist view, it is much easier to place into perspective New Deal\u0026rsquo;s zealot focus on young men, strange deficiency in some areas, and central focus on infrastructure. In that regard, the New Deal worked very well to bring a failing economy back to a semblance of normalcy for the privileged few.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbheffects_of_the_new_deal/","tags":null,"title":"effects of the New Deal"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Eleanor Roosevelt is the first lady of the US.\nCreated minimum wage Wrote a weekly column named My Day, in 135 newspapers 2x a week broadcast ","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbheleanor_roosevelt/","tags":null,"title":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A civil rights movement organizer that founded SNICK.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhella_baker/","tags":null,"title":"Ella Baker"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Your brain maintaing a stable level of energy.

At that time, I was barely beginning to be actually comfortable using the language of English.\nOne of the ways I practiced English, which is also a habit I continue to do today, is to write. I write mostly expository prose now, but, back then, shining with childish naïvete, I decided to write a multi-part story as a means of practicing English.\nAt the time, I was fortunately supported by four very helpful adults\u0026mdash;ESL instructors, teachers from the local government\u0026rsquo;s ESL program, local students, family friends\u0026mdash;who have supported me and edited this silly story as a means of helping me better my command of English.\nIronically, this story is set in 2018, I think, two years after when I wrote it. Its now 2022, almost 7 years after. Make of that what you will.\nTherefore\u0026mdash;\nNorman, an epic tale told in N parts\nWritten by yours truly, Houjun Liu, circa 2016.\nEdited by: Lynne Zummo, Dorit Hahn, Susan Cole, and Jennifer Fan.\nTypesetted: May 10th, 2022. Menlo Park, California.\nPrologue: James Peter On a sunny day, in a small house at 1623 Wesson Ave, James lay on a dirty, tiny bed. Suddenly a dog was in James’ sight. James stood up, stared at the dog. It was a small, brown, white, fuzzy dog with a tiny stump. The dog walked around James’ bed, looking silly.\n“Let’s call you Norman! It is a good name for you!”\n“There is no dog allowed in my house, get’em out! RIGHT now, or I will get YOU out!” shouted Mr. Miller.\n“Dude,” a voice came from James’ mind. Mr. Miller, the owner of the Wacky Hair Salon, who is James’ uncle, barged into James’ room, continuously shouting.\n“Get’em out, RIGHT NOW! NOW! YOU HEAR ME?”\nJames, staring at Norman, just didn’t care.\nNorman seemed to not understand all this. He followed Mr. Miller to the window, and \u0026hellip; just as suddenly as he had come in, he was thrown out by Mr. Miller.\nWhile Norman was wandering around, James started crying.\nMonths passed…\nPart 1 On a cold winter afternoon, Mr. Miller is sending James to an orphanage as punishment for doing “bad” things. James just doesn’t understand this. He SIMPLY wants Norman to come back!\nWhen they arrive, James finally realizes why he didn’t have parents. The truth is dreadful: his dad went crazy from programming in binary code.\n“I will go crazy, too,” James thinks. “It is not an easy job, no sir.” His mom’s situation was even worse, for she was killed by the African disease Ebola.\nHe trudges into the front building with Dr. Brains, and sees children that had been starved, gone mad, and even had been wandering around hopelessly! Many questions flew into James’ mind: Will I go crazy, too? Will I be starving, too? Will I also be wandering around like a zombie?! Feeling scared, he starts to wander, feel hungry, and starve like the other kids ……\n“Wait ! NO, I can’t do that,” thought James.\nDr. Brains takes James to walk around the orphanage, he realizes it is actually a better place to be rather than 1623 Wesson Ave. He sees cats, he sees ducks, he sees horses, he sees a playground, and he sees…\nNORMAN!\nPart 2 Dr. Brains, who looks bewildered, is staring at him.\n“How can you know him? You just arrived here!”.\n“Long story…,” explains James. “I once met the dog, and he was thrown out by Mr. Miller from where I used to live.”\n“So, this is PART of our orphanage. As you see, it is big. We now should thank the donor, who passed away, Dr. James Rover Peter…” There is a little pause, then Dr. Brains continues.\n“Who is YOUR dad!”\nThey continue walking until they get to a building labeled ‘EDU_K-4’.\n“This is the K-4 grade educational multifunctional building,” explains Dr. Brains, “where you will be staying for half a year. Then you will move to this building for study.”\nDr. Brains is now pointing at a building labeled ‘EX-EDU_5-12’.\nThey continue to walk until they get to another building labeled ‘OPH_LV #20312’. It is a small, lovely building, much like an apartment. “This is where you will live, in room # 20312_004,” says Dr. Brains while he hands James a key. Then he gives him a packet, which reads: Vanilla orphanage grand rules and schedule.\n“This is all you need, good day! I will leave you here.”\nJames watches Dr. Brains until he is out of sight.\nHe walks straight into the room. It looks clean, neat, like a 3-star hotel. There is a twin size bed, a desk, and a restroom. He sits down and starts to read the packet:\nChapter 1: Grand rules Welcome to Vanilla Orphanage! This is a place where you can enjoy yourself, explore yourself, and get prepared for the world!\nBut, there MUST be some rules in our orphanage to keep you and your classmates safe.\nFirst of all, you MUST not run in the front building.\nSecond, no talking is allowed while a grand meeting is taking place (see chapter 2 for more info).\nThird, follow your schedule all the time.\nFourth, if you have an emergency, use the emergency call phone (You don’t need to dial it, it will automatically connect to Vanilla Orphanage Hospital). But if you can walk and speak normally, go to Vanilla Orphanage Hospital for more help.\nFifth, the use of a regular telephone is only allowed three times a day. If your teacher calls you, it won’t count. You can only use a regular telephone for calling inside-the-orphanage friends, no outside call is allowed. To see the interior telephone numbers, see chapter 3.\nChapter 2: Grand schedule + your personal schedule Grand schedule\nYour personal schedule\nMeet me every OTHER Sunday at 15:00 at grand office starting 1/2/2019.\nGrand meeting will take place every first day of the month at the big hall in the front building. Everyone will attend the grand meeting; it lasts the whole day.\nDinner, Lunch, and Breakfast will be served at Front Building.\nDr. Flynn (k-4 Sciences) 4242-5000-2525 Dr. Jones (5-12 Sciences) 2134-1000-1045 Dr. Foster (k-4 Math) 2456-6206-6200 Ms. Garcia (5-12 Math) 1341-4000-4012 Mrs. Newman (k-4 Talk-it-out assistant) 2563-6374-7407 Mrs. Willems (5-12 Talk-it-out assistant) 8908-6997-9000 Dr. Brains (Headmaster) 2563-0035-3526\nPart 3 A brief day, he does whatever he is told, follows the schedule, does the work. But, something that amazes James is that the food is actually YUMMY.\nHe does enjoy eating at vanilla orphanage. Normally, it is like a buffet, but a limited one. You only can have one serving of meat, 2 vegetables, a delicious main dish (e.g. cooked rice, cooked noodles …).\nBy the table, James sees students laugh at each other, talk with each other, and, from far away, he sees a little brown-white puppy is running to a girl with curly hair, and stops.\nNorman!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nIt is funny that the girl asks exactly the same thing as Dr. Brains asked:” How can you know him?” He explains the whole story why he knows Norman and asks his very own and very first question to the very first student he meets at the vanilla orphanage: “How did he get here?”.\n“Long story,” says the girl, “he first arrived here because of our save the dogs project, Calvin and I found him.”\n“And who are you? I’m James”.\n“Sorry, I forgot about that, my name is Amelia!”.\nA tall, black haired student comes and joins them. “Hi there, what’s up? I heard someone mention my name.”\n“Oh, we were just talking about the dog. Our new friend, James, gave him a name: Norman,” responds Amelia.\n“Guess what?” asked Calvin, “I taught him Chinese!”.\n“Oh interesting, show us!” says Amelia.\n“狗儿，请来一下; I told him to come.” Suddenly, Norman comes and starts running around Calvin. “你的名字叫做 Norman; I told him that his name is Norman,” says Calvin. The dog starts moving around in a funny way, which James feels weird about. “Oh, don’t worry about that, that’s the Funny-Brown-Hula-Stump-Wiggle-Wag-Dance that I taught him,” Says Amelia.\nPart 4 Dong, dong, dong, dong…… The school bell rings, everyone gets up to do everything they need. It’s Sunday. According to Dr. Brains, James needs to meet Dr. Brains at the grand office.\nWhen he arrives, Dr. Brains says nothing but a greeting, and he hands James a slip of paper that says:\nThe organization of Brainiacs: 52345 Brainful way, North town, CA 94780\n“What is the org…”. “Stop! I will explain everything right after!” explains Dr. Brains. “Just remember what this parchment says!”\nHe hands him a telephone, and says, “Dial 52325, when you hear a beep, dial 900. Answer every question it’s asking you.”\nHe does what he is told, then a girl’s voice says: “Welcome to the new member registration center of TOFB, or the Organization of Brainiacs. Please answer the question: What is your address? “James states the orphanage’s address. “What is your reason to join?” Dr. Brains says quietly,” Invited.”\nWho invited you?” James answers:”Dr. Brains.” “ Welcome, again, new member. Please take the blood needle that appears in front of you and use it to poke your left ring finger.” James does this, and the voice says, ”Thanks for joining! Please hang up the phone!”\n“Understand this?” Dr. Brains says, ”Let’s go!”. “But, go where?” asks James. ”T-O-F-B,” replies Dr. Brains. They walk straight into a box, where James spots a device. Dr. Brains pushes a button on the device, and suddenly, James feels dizzy. They are spinning. They spin faster and faster. Finally, he hears a pop, then, suddenly, he falls into another device which is like a poison chamber. He and Dr. Brains open the door, and he sees a small, transparent house that reads T-O-F-B.\nPart 5 They walk straight into the house, and see a small elevator that is made out of glass. While they walk into the elevator, James feels something is seriously wrong. First, this is a one-story building, and unlike the 5th avenue apple retail store, it has no underground floor. Second, the elevator has NO button, how can Dr. Brains go anywhere with this elevator?\nDr. Brains seems solemn, he carefully looks at the emergency speaker, then, suddenly, James hears a loud CRACK. Then the elevator starts getting darker and darker. After 5 seconds, it is not transparent anymore.\nThe elevator starts to go down deeper and deeper. Then a screen pops up.”Hello, WELCOME to the Organization of Brainiacs. Please scan your card…” says a voice. He doesn’t have a card!! He looks around to find Dr. Brains, but, he is gone!\n“Where else can he be?”James thinks,”there is no way out!”. Suddenly, smoke fills the elevator, James first doesn’t realize what it is, but suddenly, he knows it.”Oh oh!” thinks James, ”IT IS GAS!!!!!”\nChapter 2: T-O-F-B Way underground, Dr. Brains hesitates. “OOOOOOOOOOPS! I forgot James in the elevator..” , he thinks, ”and the killer gas X03-00 would be deadly.”\nHe rushes to the “hacker center”, and shouts, ”You guys! STOP the elevator! And STOP the gas! Open the doors! Clear out the gas! He is NOT a criminal!”\nEverybody freezes, and some whisper, ”Oops, x03-00 gas can knock a human out in 10 seconds”.\nPart 6 Back in the elevator, James barely has time to call the emergency. “Does Dr. Brains mean to kill me?” he thinks, ”or is this a test for me?” He has more things to worry about than that. However, the good news is that Dr.Brains and his team hurry to the elevator just in time, which is when he gets knocked off. They give him the medicine that will neutralize the effect of the gas, and then they hurry to prepare the WELCOME event of the new T-O-F-B members in this season.\nSoon after, James wakes up, safe and sound. Dr. Brains is right by him.\n“Sorry for the accident, but here, welcome to T-O-F-B”, Dr. Brains says with a little smile.\nThere is a little awkward moment when he and Dr. Brains both try to say something, but no sounds come out. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. Then Dr. Brains continues, ”The Organization of Brainiacs is a little like what you see in the movie M-I-B. We basically are the only legal group in human and alien law that can meet, communicate with, and study the aliens from outer universe. You know one of our aliens: Norman. He actually can speak Hidoeneese AND English.”\n“But what is Hidoeneese?” James asks.\n“Hidoeneese is the language of the Hidonipothan.” Dr.Brains says.\n“And what is Hidonipothan?” he asks, again.\n“Long story short, it’s kind of an alien tribe. Later at breakfast, Norman will explain. By the way, he likes his name Norman.” Dr. Brains responds.\n“What? Breakfast? It’s already morning?” James asks.\n“Well yes, you have been knocked out by gas for almost 12 hours, and now it is 6:00 in the morning,” Dr. Brains says, ”you still can get about 3 hours rest. Everyone in T-O-F-B sleeps late and wakes up late. And one last thing, I will give you the NEW MEMBER #04 packet so you can learn more about T-O-F-B.”\nHe hands him a packet, just like the packet in the orphanage. But it is hand written.\nWelcome, new member, we are proud that you are here. As the founder of T-O-F-B, I will introduce you to the few basics of daily life.\nFirst, you all have an outside “job”, which you will still perform. Since you are a child, AS I KNOW, we will just keep you up-to-date and call you via the headphones that we will give you. We won’t interrupt your class, unless it is an emergency, I promise. You will be meeting once a month so it won’t affect any of your grades.\nSecond, in T-O-F-B, we treat any child like an adult. It means a large work load, but you can also access any part of our centre freely with your BNPS. But in some areas, we want you to have adult supervision.\nYour supervisor is:\nGrave Hono ( Dr. Brains, as a substitute name in the human world)\nWe will give you a map and what you should do later.\nDr. Ranboro\n9/23/2018\nPart 7 He falls asleep……… He dreams about aliens attacking the centre, and only Dr. Brains, Dr. Ranboro, Norman, Amelia, Calvin and a guy who he didn’t know survived. He thinks it’s just a dream, but what he doesn’t know is, this day is coming closer and closer.\n“Wakey, Wakey!” Dr. Brains shouts, laughing” JJJJJJJJAAAAAAMMMMMMMEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!”. James finally wakes up, and mumbles, ”What the heck in the world was this?”\nDr. Brains seems to be confused. “You didn’t recognize my voice? Wake up, Buddy! Get dressed! The welcoming party is waiting!!”.\nHe gets dressed, hurries to follow Dr. Brains, and they go outside to a “secretive” room that is labeled “G—CHECK, BNPS ROOM”. They go in, and he sees a bunch of devices that are new to him. He sits down, just as Dr. Brains ordered, and Dr. Brains brings a needle to his face, straight into his eyes. “Watch out!” James shouts. He doesn’t even have time to think, as the needle goes in and out of his eyes. Dr. Brains says, “Good, we already got the DNA, scanned the iris, scanned the brain map. Ok, 2 last things, then we are good to go!” He does a bunch of scans on James’ finger, and he enters a password into a machine. “Ok, one last thing. Print your BNPS and tattoo it to your shoulder!” Dr. Brains says. The machine reads “bring human to the tattoo station …… step 3/5”. Dr. Brains orders him to put his shoulder into a cylinder. He feels a little pressure and his shoulder pops out of the machine. He sees a little piece of metal on his shoulder and it reads ”TOFB.1029358612.JP/////////” The machine also prints out a metal card. “Don’t lose it!” Dr. Brains says, “it is your ID here!”\nThey walk out of the room and into the elevator. It is an elevator like the one in the TOFB’s entrance. The one that changes color and transparency, only much more slowly. When it tells him to scan the card, he knows better than to not do so. The elevator seems smart, and it asks “Homo, and James! Morning! Which level area do you want to go to?”. Dr. Brains responds, “Dining room number three, formal, both of us”. The elevator responds with a “TOFB wishes you a pleasant day!” When the door opens again, they enter a large area, like the first level of a 5 star hotel. Everything is white: people’s clothes, the ground, the staircase, the light, etc,. He sees Dr.Brains’ clothes change to white! He says, “Dr.Brains! Your outfit changed color!” “Yours did, too!” Dr. Brains responds. James looks down at his clothes. His had actually, as Dr. Brains said, changed color and texture.\nThey eat their breakfast—salmon, soup and broccoli, and Dr. Brains announces to him, “OK, now let’s do some work stuff”. They head back to the living area, and they wash themselves. Then they head to the meeting area. Norman, Dr. Ranboro and the other guy James sees in his dream are waving to James-and-Dr.Brains-in-the-black-suit-and-a-tie.\nPart 8 “So”, Dr. Ranboro says, “Welcome! Thank you for joining the organiza………?!!!\u0026gt;?*\u0026amp;%*\u0026amp;^%\u0026amp;^%%∆˙ßå˚µß∂˙”. FFF! A small arrow flies though the walls and hits Dr. Ranboro, making his words into nonsense. “å∆∆ß¬—å˚å!!!!!!¡¡¡¡¡¡?¿!¡……Jams…….main sq……is com…..tel..hom……nnnoor…….¡¡¡!!!???¿¿¿å∂ß˚˚˚˚∆ƒå˙”, he says. James can barely understand, but he knows one thing, they will tell him about the main sq…whatsoever.\n“Let’s jump into the topic,” Norman says. “The main sq… is actually an attack called The Main Square Rattle, or what we call TMSR. It’s started because another kind of alien, The Froakan, wants to use humans as slaves, own the TOFB AND the Hidonipothan.The only way to stop that is to get the battle-rattler and rattle it. But if The F’s got the rattler and rattle it, well, we will all freeze and do what they want, like a bunch of zombies. The state of being a zombie is called ratling. Sadly, there isn’t a known cure yet for ratle. But Dr. Brains is working on it! Lastly, the battle-rattler is locked in the Ratle Mountains. And the only way to enter the Ratle Mountain is by using Dr. Ranboro’s key. Otherwise, you will have very little chance to get out alive! And that’s why they shot Dr. Ranboro. As a matter of fact, the arrow is poisonous. If we don’t send him to hospital now, he will become a baby in 72 hours.”\nTalking about Dr. Ranboro, James notices Dr. Ranboro’s hair getting darker and darker from the old-man-white. They send him to the hospital about 5 minutes later.\nChapter 3:That’s called war After another ride on the “TOTP—0111”, which is the “squeeze box” to get to the North Town, they are back at Dr. Brains’ office. But something weird has happened, only students in OPH_LV # 40000 - OPH_LV # 49999 are still in the orphanage. Dr. Brains tries to find out why, but he can’t. And that’s when all of the humans in the orphanage hear a gigantic laugh coming from nowhere.”HHHAAAHHHAAAAHAHHAAA! This is your day, Homo, your death ceremony!HHAAHAHA!”\nMonths passed again……..\nPart 9 The daily live is almost the same as before, just that a part of the students in the orphanage is missing. But live is still very simple. Tasty food, friendly teachers, and visits to TOFB every other week.\nOne day, James is in his math class.\n“So when 2 is raised to the……”\n“Beep! Beep!”\nHis secret headphones from TOFB send a message request to him.\n“Beep! Beep!”\n“Didn’t that Ranboro guy say they won’t interrupt our classes?” James thought.\n“And let’s do some prob….”\n“Beep! Beep!”\nJames requests a bathroom break and answers the headphones in the boys’ restroom.\n“It’s an emergency!!! The Froakans are getting closer to the rattler!!! Help!!!! James, take Homo and get here now!” Norman cries.\nAs fast as he can, he rushes to Dr. Brains’ office, grabs Dr. Brains and locks him and himself into the TOTB-0111.\nAnd as fast as lightning, they are here, in the North town.\nThey rush into the elevator, he swipes his and Dr. Brains’ card and rushes to Dr. Ranboro’s office.\n“Quick! They will rattle it in like…like 20 minutes and we will all ratle!!!”, Norman hollers.\nAnd again, as fast as lightning, they get war-dressed and get into the fastest transport system in TOFB.\nAs James looks down, he is wearing a strong iron chest plate that reads ’T-O-F-B///////The Smarter one’. And on his shoulder, there is a cord which extends from his Digital ID to the chest plate. There is a screen in his chest plate that is unbreakable. There is a soft protection layer, then there is a swimming layer, then the pressure layer, an iron pad, an air supply on his side if the enemy spreads poisonous gas, and an armor on the outside.\nAmazingly, these things only weigh 1 pound and fit perfectly.\nHe is war-trained, so he knows exactly what to do with this fancy outfit. The screen is the main control, the outfit will detect the environment and change to the perfect layer.\nUploaded ate 10/25/2015 [sic.]\nPart 10 The ride seems to be long, but it’s actually only 5 minutes. They will enter the Ratle Mountains from the North End, which is the second-safest route into the mountains without Dr. Ranboro’s key.\nAnd there they are, in the Ratle Mountains. They are led by Mr. Giose, who was the other guy in his dream when he came to the TOFB the first time. The other four warriors are Norman, Dr. Ranboro, Dr. Brains and James. The first 20 miles are short and boring. Nothing happens. But after the 29th mile mark, they enter a cave.\nThe cave is dark. There are only few lights flashing. They are not worried, until they hear a scream.\n“OOOOOOO! Eeeek!”\n“Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! ZZZ! ZZZ…ZZZ..ZZZ…ZZZ…ZZZ…zzz…” The voice is getting smaller and smaller.\n“It is the sleeping spider! It will knock out a human in NO time!” Mr. Giose shouts.\nJames and the whole crew know what to do. They press a few buttons on their screens, and their helmets of their armor dissolve into the air. What is left behind, is the air filtering system.\n“Three! Two! One! It’s gas,” Norman says, playfully.\nDr. Brains spreads out the SSG gas, which will, hopefully, knock out the sleeping spider.\nThat wastes a LOT of time. Before they know it, they all starts to ratle.\nIt is James who feels it first. He feels extremely and uncontrollably happy. He starts running around and talking to other people in a rude way. To himself, it feels like as if he is drifting into unconsciousness.\nThen the same happens to Dr. Brains, and then Norman, followed by Mr. Giose. Luckily, Dr. Ranboro called the TOFB’s team 2 to come for help before he changes, too.\nI never knew what happened after this incident until the year of 2021. Since James was ratling, he couldn’t remember the whole year of 2020. He recovered on the day of 10/26/2021. Dr. Foster, who works at the orphanage AND at TOFB found a cure using Chinese Herbal Tea.\nWell, let’s jump into the time machine. Backward to 2014!!\nChapter 4:Childhood We jump into the time machine, and swoosh. Here we are, in the year of 2014. We are standing in front of 1623 Wesson Ave. It is a sunny day. The Peters are getting ready for a trip to Africa. James greets his uncle, who will look after the house while they are gone. Mrs. Peter is packing hastily. And Mr. Peter is bringing his computer, because, weirdly, he is starting to like CODING in BINARY CODE. Nothing more to say, so here the story goes.\nPart 11 “Hurrrrrryyyy!” Mr. Peter shouts. “Or else we will be late for the plane!”\nThe Peters hurry to the bus stand, waiting for the airport express.\nAfter about an hour ride, they finally arrive at the San Francisco International Airport.\nThey check in.

And of course it was the businessmen and middle-class Protestants who controlled the political parties, particularly that party which was supposed to be the more conservative one\nBecause there is nothing to conserve about current system, the thing that\u0026rsquo;s conserved is free choice If something were going to be conserved, it would normally be the no-conscription and low-taxation (and free-choice) system.\nEconomic systems propergated the source of American patriotism This meant that people who thought of themselves as American patriots or nationalists, and who sought to conserve the American nation and to promote American national interests\nAmerican conservatism is actually a form of European liberalism we have seen that, from a European perspective, American conservatism was not conservative at all, but actually was a kind of classical lib- eralism.\nwartime strengthened American values and liberalism Moreover, the wartime experience seemed decisively to vindicate and even enhance the strengths of both the traditional American economic system and traditional American moral principles.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhrise_of_american_conservatism/","tags":null,"title":"Origins of American Conservatism"},{"categories":null,"contents":" No Demo Day TODO Email need statement template Needfinding Not all patients want to be treated the same way Attitudes towards heathcare system Fostering strong interaction; facilitate interaction Problem: patients have attitudes that physicians can\u0026rsquo;t effectively communicate.\nAction item: interview doctors and patients\nNeed two need statement.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhpcp_april_checkin/","tags":null,"title":"PCP April Checkin"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We will leverage atoms as qubits.

It\u0026rsquo;s amazing. I will not repeat here anything mentioned there.\nPat yourself on the back Oh god was that a difficult semester. We got through many a challenges and worked together to solve most of them. That\u0026rsquo;s cool.

What changes? How can you help? Will meetings finally end on time? When will Jack finish asking silly questions? Find out more\u0026hellip; below.\nBut not too hard Just to reiterate our master deliverable as a team (like how this pitch is culminating the deliverable assigned to us on 1/6), we have until July 8th, 2022 to pitch, again:\nWhat exactly are we doing, in one line, in laymen\u0026rsquo;s terms? Why is it helpful? Clarify the roles and responsibilities for the \u0026ldquo;master faculty member\u0026rdquo;, what time commitments and value they add, and what they have to drop to support the program How can we derive legitimacy for what we are doing? (see below) For me, he also added the derivable of talking more slowly. Presumably, De wants us to come with a glossy pitch too.\nBe legit Why do we need \u0026ldquo;legitimacy\u0026rdquo;? We need motivation for kids to do this, and Nueva\u0026rsquo;s rubber stamp would be a good way to do so. this is the focus of how we are asking Lisa to greenlight phase 2 (see below)\nA valid answer for \u0026ldquo;legitimacy\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;adding the list of skills students achieved on their transcript.\u0026rdquo; Is this a good answer? Not at the moment. Its very unmotivated (this response does not pass the \u0026ldquo;why is that helpful?\u0026rdquo; test).\nAnd follow the yellow-brick road There is going to be a three stage roadmap.\nPhase -1: developing answers to PREPARE to pitch to Liza the idea, asking her to give feedback WITHOUT any of the \u0026ldquo;asks\u0026rdquo; (legitimacy, faculty time, etc.) Phase 1: building a down-scaled version of the program somewhere. Ted has mentioned interest in this, so we maybe able to co-opt some or all of his classes. Developing details and proof-of-feasibility to pitch to Liza again, this time WITH the asks to roll out to the whole school Phase 2: roll out to the whole school and prey to the Research Gods But not the leader I can\u0026rsquo;t be around forever. We are in phase -1; I will probably be gone in the middle of phase 1. We will probably have to have a faculty supporting this program unofficially for sometime, which will be a big ask.\nThis means we have to make some program changes in anticipation\u0026mdash;\nSeek a corpus callosotomy \u0026ldquo;R@N\u0026rdquo; is now separated form \u0026ldquo;Nueva Research Program.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;R@N\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;s purpose is a working group to build the \u0026ldquo;Nueva Research Program.\u0026rdquo;\nWe need to separate the two as soon as possible, so that means soon. As soon as after the 7/8 deadline, I hope to make this happen. This means changes changes to our leadership structure.\nAs node A.2 outlines, \u0026ldquo;Nueva Research Program\u0026rdquo; meetings have three stable positions.\nTeams’ Stable — Responsible for managing the count, content, and quality of active Research at Nueva projects, as well as the proces of matching team members to teams. (2-3 hrs/wk) Content Stable — Responsible for managing the content of the training program and review teams. Responsible for updating nodes. Runs meetings. (1-2 hrs/wk) Participant Stable — Responsible for managing the count and recruitment of new students into the program, and identifying key experts and mentors to help build new nodes or support the program. Responsible for participant sheet (1-2 hrs/wk) As well as three review teams\nHypothesis Sciences (key mentor: TBD) Non-Hypothesis Sciences (key mentor: Ted) Literacy, Soft Skills, and Development (key mentor: TBD) In a meeting (TBD) before 7/8, we will organize ourselves into three pairs again. Each pair will choose one \u0026ldquo;stable\u0026rdquo; role and one \u0026ldquo;review team\u0026rdquo; role\u0026mdash;essentially acting as a joint-power head for the new program and a review team in itself.\nWe will split our meetings from then on in half; the first bit dealing with R@N, which I will run; the second, ACTUALLY DOING Nueva Research Programs\u0026rsquo; work, lead by the \u0026ldquo;content stable\u0026rdquo; team. This also means that we will separate the two work docs.\nOh, yeah, also, if you have gotten this far; the headings of this document forms a pretty bad poem. Please send this poem to me privately on a direct message. Thank you.\nPresumably, much of the early \u0026ldquo;nueva research program\u0026rdquo; meetings will be solely the participant stable thinking about recruiting metrics and content stable voting on new nodes. That\u0026rsquo;s OK. The protocol\u0026rsquo;s there to be changed if needed.\nBut not without your consent Although we want each and every one of you on the team (evidenced by the fact that we will be pretty screwed if anyone leaves), your main academics comes first. Please talk to me privately if you have any concerns, no harm no foul.\nAlrighty. Let\u0026rsquo;s find a time to meet.\nhttps://www.when2meet.com/?15887080-XHXI8\nI kinda want to meet y\u0026rsquo;all physically over coffee if you want; but if not virtual is all good.\nThanks again for everything!\n\u0026mdash;Jack\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhresearch_at_nueva_notes_06_09_2022/","tags":null,"title":"Regarding R@N"},{"categories":null,"contents":"background info Recall asymtotic analysis.

The same rule applies through this guide as well.\nStackExchange A group of very mean people put together a very helpful family of websites which are essentially vicious forum boards. They are the StackExchange family of boards.\nThe most famous of which, and the one focused on programming, is called StackOverflow. StackOverflow (\u0026ldquo;SO\u0026rdquo;) is an extremely helpful resource for browsing any question you may have. For instance, if your code crashes with a stack trace, Googling the error and set site:stackoverflow.com will get you pretty far.\nIf you ask a question, though, be prepared to get yelled at though, the likely reason is that your question is already answered.\nmacOS Get a macBook. Even the cheapest one.\nDevelopment on Windows is like cooking on campfire. Doable, useful for specific things, but not great overall. If you must use a PC, put Debian/Ubuntu/some easy to use Linux on it. Windows is just terrible.\n*nix Terminal BSD/UNIX terminal is a tool that essentially skips the fancy user interface (UI) which your operating system draws and directly runs things \u0026ldquo;organically.\u0026rdquo; If you see something in a guide that says like:\n\u0026ldquo;please execute\u0026rdquo;\npython3 test.py or perhaps\nwget https://wandb.ai/jemoka \u0026gt;\u0026gt; test they are probably asking you to type it (\u0026ldquo;execute it\u0026rdquo;) into the Terminal and hit enter.\nRead this guide put together by the Ubuntu people, it\u0026rsquo;s very good. To open the terminal on your macOS device, open an app called Terminal.app. On Ubuntu, I believe its also an app called terminal.\nIDE An \u0026ldquo;IDE\u0026rdquo; is an Integrated Development Environment. It is where code is written. Fortunately, this is an easy one: use VSCode. There is literally no better tool out there for beginners and advanced users; no wonder it has 70% market share.\nSidenote: But Jack? What do you use? I use something called emacs for very specific reasons. Please don\u0026rsquo;t unless you really want misery and to learn a whole language to configure it.\nComputer Language Architecture This is how an idea turns into \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo; on your screen.\nHuman programming languages (\u0026ldquo;Python\u0026rdquo;), are a very readable sort of code. No computers can actually read it. Usually, code you write goes through a three-step process before its able to be ran.\nFirst, the language you write gets converted by a \u0026ldquo;compiler\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;interpreter\u0026rdquo;, specialized pieces of code that takes human programming languages into a more machine-readable form of code named \u0026ldquo;assembly\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;byte code\u0026rdquo; respectively, called the \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo;.\nFor now, think of the difference between compilers and interpreters as translating code either all-at-once (compilers) or line-by-line (interpreters). Because the former has a grander view of the whole, languages that use a compiler (\u0026ldquo;compiled languages\u0026rdquo;) are faster. Although, many programmers find languages that use in interpreter (\u0026ldquo;interpreted language\u0026rdquo;) easier because they can spot problems line by line.\nBut wait! There\u0026rsquo;s more. Assembly and byte-code (what compilers and interpreters generate) are not actually runnable by a computer. Yet another piece of software called a \u0026ldquo;runtime\u0026rdquo; takes the reasonably-machine-readable code and actually performs the required operations.\nSome runtimes for languages like C++ uses the raw x86 CPU, which is the stereotypical \u0026ldquo;binary\u0026rdquo; zeros-and-ones. Some other languages, say Java, uses horribly complex runtimes that amounts to a whole virtual machine.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a table.\nLanguage C/I Compiler/Interpreter Intermediate Runtime Python I python python bytecode python Java C javac java object java VM JavaScript I V8 (literally) js bytecode web browser! C/C++ C gcc/clang x86 asm x86 cpu Wonder what the runtimes for languages like Java are built in? C/C++. Eventually it all becomes x86 cpu instructions but its like a layer cake. This is why Python and friends are called a \u0026ldquo;higher level language\u0026rdquo;.\ngit Git is where all the code is!\nGit is a decentralized \u0026ldquo;version-control\u0026rdquo; system. It is basically a timestamp-backup system of code with messages and branching.\nGitHub is a website where people like to back up their code. Here\u0026rsquo;s my profile on GitHub.\nManaging Git is pretty\u0026hellip; Involved. It, for instance, assumes familiarity with the Terminal as described above. I suggest learning it, though: learn git and learn GitHub.\nIndustry-Specific Skills What you start with doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, but start with something Its easiest to learn programming if you have a project in mind. So, find a project in mind\u0026mdash;what it is, though, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The concepts across programming are highly transferable, but the actual skill is easiest to learn if you are learning w.r.t. a project.\nData science, prototyping, and machine learning Python would be your friend for all things of programming where the act of programming is a means to an end. That is: if you are writing code to do something that\u0026rsquo;s not inherently software (data science, machine learning, heck, also manipulating quantum qubits), Python is your friend.\nIts a language that\u0026rsquo;s designed to be easy to write: is a very do-as-I-say language that sacrifices efficiency and elegance for getting crap done. This is how I started programming. This is the book I started with. It teaches Python through programming a series of small projects that are mostly Terminal games.\nTo learn data science, Nueva\u0026rsquo;s very own data science course give very good conceptual framework. A typical first project is to recognize pictures of handwritten digits, for which there is a good guide.\nGoogle also: pip, ipython, Jupyter.\nBackend engineering Backend engineering is the science of dealing with databases and writing API (application programming interfaces). I don\u0026rsquo;t suggest starting with this, but if you are particularly interested in databases, you could!\nTo master backend engineering, first learn a database manipulation language. For 99.98% of the industry, this means mysql. The link directs to a pretty good guide.\nFurthermore, the language with which backend is written is Java. I hate to say it, but despite Java\u0026rsquo;s terribleness (don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it ;)) its very dependable. Here\u0026rsquo;s a book on Java. In general, I really like all of the books from no starch press.\nFrontend and Web engineering Do you like making stuff move? Do you like drawing buttons? Front end maybe for you. The most basic type of front-end engineering is making websites.\nStart by making a \u0026ldquo;vanilla website\u0026rdquo;: HTML (what\u0026rsquo;s on the page), CSS (what colours and sizes), JavaScript (how it moves) is the standard trio of languages to start. freeCodeCamp (a great Medium blog, check their stuff out) has a good guide on the matter.\nHowever, as you progress in your journey, you will find these tools woefully inadequate. Hence, most people writing web front end move on to something called a \u0026ldquo;JavaScript Framework\u0026rdquo;, a tool to generate a \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; website from some more easily manipulable JS (changing the text on the page moves from a four line operation (indexing, selecting, grabbing, changing) to a one-liner (state.text=new text)).\nA popular JS framework is ReactJS. Check them out.\nFullstack Engineering Frontend + Backend.\nGame development Game development is honestly one of the most horribly complicated and richly science-y part of CS. I am not super experience in game development but learning C++ and mastering Unity, the game engine. Oh, right, game dev is the only, and I repeat only (with invisible footnotes and qualifications) reason why you should be writing code on Windows.\nA friend is good at game dev, I can make an intro if needed.\nGood Luck! Remember: Google-fu and project-based curiosity is your friend. Let me know if you have questions.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhsoftware_dev_starter_pack/","tags":null,"title":"software dev starter pack"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Reading notes Because feeling for self-endowment, they wish to build socialist society As Communists considered themselves as a vanguard of the revolutionary proletariat – their “aim” was to build socialist society in the whole world.\nSocialist had necesity against capitalist aggression The Soviet approaches towards historical descriptions of the twentieth century showed that with the emergence of the new type of state – socialist one – it became a target for capitalist aggression.\nSocialist revolution requires the creation of socialist society against the world It was first positive move towards realization of the Soviet foreign policy main idea: the world socialist revolution and creation of the socialist society in the whole world.\nThe Soviets believe that the US wants to take over world The US had plans to dominate in the entire world.\nThat the US was intentionally sturggling with socialism All US post-war foreign policy doctrines were aimed on the struggle with socialism\nthat soviets believed that US was exclusivly fighting socialism We can summarize – that on Soviet point of view all American presidents of Cold War period were creating their own doctrines, and all of them were anti-communist and anti-Soviet\nSoviets believes that the US made the first move Soviet concept first vivid steps, which signalized about the start of the confrontation between East and West, were steps made by the West.\nbelieves its a fight against imperialism bipolar confrontation had western roots and the Cold War was the policy of the US and other imperialistic countries against socialist countries.\ncommunism is working towards revolution mankind is a process of revolutionary changes\nthe soviet union believes only it can stop American aggression the Soviet Union was the only power in the world able to stop American ambitions of superpower.\nUSSR believes that itself was the only defender The Soviet Union considered itself as the only defender of the interests of the working class all over the world because it was the first socialist state in history.\nDefinding US and defending imperialism The Imperialistic was the system of capitalist countries: they had a lot of contradictions in their “camp” where each wanted to solve their problems and to defend their own interests by using the others.\nBlack and white view of the world prevailed USSR The entire world was separated into two main categories: friends and enemies.
