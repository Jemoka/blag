Schlesinger\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal, William E. Leuchtenburg\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal, Anthony Badger\u0026rsquo;s Appraisal of the New Deal.\nThrough the analysis of the New Deal programs, what was particularly salient was Anthony Badger\u0026rsquo;s framing of the event as not one that is ultimately \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; but instead one which focuses on its long-term effects in context with the future policies. The equivocal labeling allows nuance that places the Deal properly in its historical content. According to Badger, helping the poor, a significant policy goal of the deals, were left as \u0026ldquo;unfinished business\u0026rdquo; when going to war. This idea contrasts with William E. Leuchtenburg\u0026rsquo;s framing of the same event\u0026mdash;that it was never the true intention of the deal to assist in subsidies on a humane level, but that which supported the economy and incidentally those that reaped benefits on it.\nThis new frame is much more useful when analyzing the deal. In fact, Leuchtenburg took this a step further and claimed that the New Deal didn\u0026rsquo;t work largely because it was impossible for it to have repaired the damage by the Hoover administration. Furthermore, according to Schlesinger, programs like the NRA were created with already the clear assumption that there were not enough policy tools in place to actually achieve it to the fullest extent. Under this mind frame, then, it is not difficult to see the New Deal as one that intentionally brought a failing US economy\u0026mdash;and those participating in it\u0026mdash;to full swing whilst ignoring those that didn\u0026rsquo;t have an economic influence. It was, therefore, never about helping \u0026ldquo;people\u0026rdquo;: it is a policy and economic tool like any other.\nThrough this somewhat revisionist view, it is much easier to place into perspective New Deal\u0026rsquo;s zealot focus on young men, strange deficiency in some areas, and central focus on infrastructure. In that regard, the New Deal worked very well to bring a failing economy back to a semblance of normalcy for the privileged few.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbheffects_of_the_new_deal/","tags":null,"title":"effects of the New Deal"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Eleanor Roosevelt is the first lady of the US.\n Created minimum wage Wrote a weekly column named My Day, in 135 newspapers 2x a week broadcast  ","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbheleanor_roosevelt/","tags":null,"title":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Your brain maintaing a stable level of energy.

Because there are no sliding (hence there are no heat), there is not going to be another component (beyond rotational, translational, and potential energy.)\nWe know, then:\n\\begin{equation} \\Delta KE +\\Delta PE = 0 \\end{equation}\nFrom the fact that the object slid from the top of the ramp (\\(h\\)), we know that the sliding took a total potential energy loss of \\(Mg\\Delta h\\).\nTherefore:\n\\begin{equation} -Mgh + \\frac{1}{2} M{v_f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_o {\\omega_f}^2 = 0 \\end{equation}\nSeparating the variable off to both sides:\n\\begin{align} \u0026amp;\\frac{1}{2} M{v_f}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I_o {\\omega_f}^2 = Mgh\\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; M{v_f}^2 + I_o {\\omega_f}^2 = 2 Mgh \\end{align}\nBecause there are no sliding:\n\\begin{equation} {\\omega_f} R = v_f \\end{equation}\nWe now have two equations and two variables:\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{cases} M{v_f}^2 + I_o {\\omega_f}^2 = 2 Mgh\\\\ {\\omega_f} R = v_f \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\nSubstituting the second result into the top expression:\n\\begin{equation} M{\\omega_f}^2 R^2 + I_0{\\omega_f}^2 = 2Mgh \\end{equation}\nFinally, solving for \\(\\omega_f\\):\n\\begin{align} \u0026amp;{\\omega_f}^2(M R^2 + I_0) = 2Mgh\\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp;{\\omega_f}^2 = \\frac{2Mgh}{(M R^2 + I_0)}\\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp;{\\omega_f} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nMultiplying the expression by \\(R\\) to figure \\(v_f\\):\n\\begin{equation} v_f = R\\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}\\ \\blacksquare \\end{equation}\nAcceleration and Angular Acceleration Taking the timed derivative of \\(v_f\\):\n\\begin{equation} a_{CM} = \\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}} \\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}} \\frac{dh}{dt} \\end{equation}\nto figure change in height, we see that, because of the ramp:\n\\begin{equation} \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{d c}{dt} \\sin\\theta \\end{equation}\nwhere \\(c\\) is the ramp remaining.\nFurthermore, we see that:\n\\begin{equation} \\frac{dc}{dt} = \\vec{v} \\end{equation}\nHence:\n\\begin{equation} \\frac{dh}{dt} = R\\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}\\sin\\theta \\end{equation}\nSubstituting this back to the expression:\n\\begin{align} a_{CM} \u0026amp;= \\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}} \\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0} R\\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0}}\\sin\\theta\\\\ \u0026amp;= R^2 \\frac{Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0} \\sin\\theta\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nThe same logic follows for \\(\\alpha\\), simply without an extra constant of \\(R\\) being multiplied. To figure out its derivative, then we can again divide \\(R\\) out from the above expression to result in:\n\\begin{align} \\alpha_{CM} \u0026amp;= R \\frac{Mgh}{M R^2 + I_0} \\sin\\theta\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nProblem 6: Force and Torque Figuring Torque We will figure torque for the object, then use it for calculations. We will set the origin of the system to the lower-left of the triangle.\nWe will set the origin as being at the center of mass at the top of the ramp. Gravity and normal force, therefore, is coaxial with the center of mass and hence not accounted for here.\nWe see that:\n\\begin{equation} I_0\\alpha = -RF \\end{equation}\nRelating the slide down the ramp:\n\\begin{equation} Mg\\sin\\theta - F = Ma_x \\end{equation}\nAnd finally, relating rotational and acceleration movements, given no sliding:\n\\begin{equation} a_x = R\\alpha \\end{equation}\nWe now have three expressions relating unknowns \\(\\alpha\\), \\(F\\), and \\(a_x\\). Substituting both expressions into the second:\n\\begin{align} \u0026amp;F = \\frac{-I_0\\alpha}{R} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; Ma_x = Mg\\sin\\theta - \\frac{I_0\\alpha}{R} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; MR\\alpha = Mg\\sin\\theta - \\frac{I_0\\alpha}{R} \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; MR\\alpha + \\frac{I_0\\alpha}{R}= Mg\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\alpha\\left(MR + \\frac{I_0}{R}\\right)= Mg\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\alpha\\left(\\frac{MR^2+I_0}{R}\\right)= Mg\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\alpha= Mg\\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{R}{MR^2+I_0}\\right) \\\\ \\Rightarrow \u0026amp; \\alpha= R\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nWe can see that the expression derived here is exactly the same as that found with energetic methods above.\nWe can figure \\(a_{CM}\\) by simply multiplying again the above expression with \\(R\\):\n\\begin{equation} a_{CM} = R^2\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\ \\blacksquare \\end{equation}\nTime to reach bottom We can figure the time to reach bottom by integrating \\(a_{CM}\\) twice then solving for time.\n\\begin{equation} \\iint R^2\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\ dt \\end{equation}\nNow, we understand that the initial velocity and position of the object is \\(0\\). Hence:\n\\begin{equation} \\iint R^2\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\ dt = R^2\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right \\frac{t^2}{2} \\end{equation}\nTo figure the time at the bottom of the ramp, we solve the above-derived expression for travel throughout the length of the ramp:\n\\begin{align} \u0026amp;\\left\\frac{R^2Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right \\frac{t^2}{2} = \\frac{h}{\\sin\\theta} \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \u0026amp;t^2 = \\frac{MR^2+I_0}{R^2Mg\\sin\\theta }\\frac{2h}{\\sin\\theta} \\\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \u0026amp;t = \\sqrt{\\frac{MR^2+I_0}{R^2Mg\\sin\\theta }\\frac{2h}{\\sin\\theta} }\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\ \u0026amp;t = \\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta} \\sqrt{\\frac{2h(MR^2+I_0)}{Mg}}\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nAngular Velocity at the Bottom We can figure the angular velocity at the bottom by taking a single integral of the expression for angular acceleration, then supplying the right-derived expression for \\(t\\).\n\\begin{equation} \\int \\alpha\\ dt = \\omega = tR\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right \\end{equation}\nSupplying the expression for \\(t\\) above herein:\n\\begin{align} \\omega_f \u0026amp;= R\\left(\\frac{1}{R\\sin\\theta} \\sqrt{\\frac{2h(MR^2+I_0)}{Mg}}\\right)\\left\\frac{Mg\\sin\\theta }{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{2h(MR^2+I_0)}{Mg}}\\left\\frac{Mg}{MR^2+I_0}\\right\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{2h(MR^2+I_0)}{Mg}}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{Mg}{MR^2+I_0}\\right)^2}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{2Mgh}{MR^2+I_0}}\\ \\blacksquare \\end{align}\nWe can see that this result agrees with that above.\nFoods for Thought  The object is currently rolling perfectly; apart from counteracting slide, friction does not translate the point of contact (otherwise, it would be doing sliding) at all\u0026mdash;hence doing no work. The slope of the ramp, \\(\\theta\\) is not in the expression for \\(\\omega_f\\) \u0026mdash; meaning it has no influence on the final angular velocity.  A table!

I take a crap tonnes of notes, and sometimes people want to see a copy of them.\nIn order to facilitate this, some friends and I created taproot, a collective note-taking effort which also automatically compiled pretty cool previews and an internet site. I still am one of the primary maintainers of taproot.\nWhile working on the project, however, we noticed that the loop-based architecture (instead of being based on events/triggers), lack of duplicity, and requirement of a central build server made it difficult.\nIn this vein, quantumish (also with his own lovely set of notes, tap on the link!) and I were discussing if the essentials of taproot can be built into a static site generator. Hence, this is an experiment (to hopefully be merged with the taproot group) to facilitate this.\n","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhstarting_with_why_the_knowledgebase/","tags":null,"title":"Starting With Why: The Knowledgebase"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtariffs/","tags":null,"title":"tariffs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhteddy_roosevelt/","tags":null,"title":"Teddy Roosevelt"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://kb.jemoka.com/posts/kbhtherma/","tags":null,"title":"therma"},{"categories":null,"contents":"WPA is the largest relief program ever in the Great Depression New Deal, to promote public infrastructure and create artistic murals.
